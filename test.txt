COLD OPEN 
1 INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - MORNING - DAY 1 1 
The office has been transformed into a massive headquarters  for the Harvest Festival. Maps, lists, schedules, and signs  cover the walls and many of the windows. 
LESLIE addresses TOM, RON, BEN, APRIL, ANDY, and DONNA in the  central area. 
LESLIE 
Harvest Festival starts tomorrow. You’ve  
worked so hard and I’m so impressed by  
all of you. And... I have a very special  
surprise that will put the icing on the  
cake. It is the best possible thing that  
could potentially ever happen anywhere,  
to anyone, in the history of the  
universe. Ladies and gentlemen... Li’l  
Sebastian. 
JERRY walks in with LI’L SEBASTIAN, an adorable miniature  horse with ribbons in his hair. Except for Ben, everyone is  incredibly excited. 
OMG!TOM 

DONNA 
Noooooooooooo wayyyyyyyyyyy! 
ANDY 

Take my picture take my picture take my  picture. 
RON 
Well done, Leslie! Well done! 
APRIL 

Wow. 
(sincere) 
(smug) 
LESLIE 

Thank you. Thank you. 
 LESLIE TALKING HEAD  
LESLIE 
Li’l Sebastian made his debut at the last  
Harvest Festival in 1 and he was an  
instant phenomenon. That week, he was  
the eighth most photographed object in  
all of America. Suck it, The Alamo! 
B-roll 1 Indianapolis Star Little Horse is Big Deal.

 INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - D1  
BEN 
What am I missing? What’s the deal with  
the pony? 
TOM 
He’s not a pony! He’s a mini-horse! 
BEN 
...Okay. Well, why is he so famous?  
Does he do anything? 
People shake their heads sadly at Ben’s ignorance. 
APRIL 
Yeah -- he does being a small horse, and  
he does it better than anyone. 
RON 
Son, this horse has an honorary degree  
from Notre Dame. 
LESLIE 
We have to be very careful. He’s twenty three-years-old, he has cataracts in both  
eyes, and severe arthritis. Jerry’s  
going to look after him. 
JERRY 
(proud) 
We’re on the same diabetes medication. 
(to horse; cutesy voice) 
Who’s my little Glucatrol buddy? 
Ben looks at Li’l Sebastian. He leans in to pet him... 
BEN 
Well, I guess he is kinda cute-- 
LESLIE 
Don’t touch him! 
Ben throws up his hands and backs off. 
BEN 
Okay. God. 
LESLIE 
I seriously almost just punched you. 
END OF COLD OPEN

ACT ONE 
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER - D1  
Leslie, Ben, and Tom sit across from SUE. A MAP with little  signs representing different businesses sits between them.  Tom listens to his iPod. 
SUE 
(switching two signs) 
Couldn’t you put Sue’s Salads... here? 
LESLIE 
(horrified) 
On Deep Fried Boulevard? 
SUE 
It’s just... there are so many junk food  
places and only one salad stand. 
LESLIE 
Yes, because we’re trying to make money  
and not make people hate their lives. 
(sigh) 
How about this we’ll make Sue’s Salads  
the official Harvest Festival Healthy  
Choice. 
SUE 
Wow -- that’s great. Thank you. 

Of course. 
As Sue leaves... 
LESLIE 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 

(mumbles) 
No one’s gonna come to your stupid booth  
anyway. 
 LESLIE TALKING HEAD  B-roll of Leslie and various PEOPLE. 
LESLIE 
Harvest Fest is the biggest thing I’ve  
done in my career and if it fails, the  
Parks Department will be eliminated.  
(getting amped) 
That’s why we went big seven days. Two  
hundred vendors. Fifty thousand  
visitors... and four hospitality kiosks!  
(MORE) 

 .     LESLIE (CONT'D) 
(thinks) 
I gotta stop ending on that boring thing. 
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - D1  A WEIRDO sits across from them. 
LESLIE 
No, you can’t sell “Home Brewed Water.”  
And again, no, I don’t want to taste it.  
Thanks for coming in. 
The guy leaves. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
(calling out) 
April? Next. 
BEN 
Man, you’re knocking these off. You’re  
like a ninja crossed with a Jedi. 
TOM 
You’re like a nerd crossed with a dork. 
BEN 
“Star Wars” isn’t that nerdy, Tom. 
LESLIE 
(”yes it is”) 
No. Not at all. 
April walks in with KEN HOTATE (Native American, 0s),  wearing a tan suit and cowboy boots. 
APRIL 
This guy’s here. 
She leaves. 
KEN 
Hi, Leslie. 
LESLIE 
(aside to Ben) 
Ben, this is Ken Hotate, tribal leader of  
the Wamapoke.  
(to Ken) 
Wallaho nahk-a-tokeh. 
SUBTITLE “Hello, honored guest.” 

Wallaho. 
KEN 


 .    
LESLIE 
(to Ben) 
That means “hello, honored guest.”  
Though, it literally translates to “May  
you be blessed with a million possums.”  
The Wamapoke once used possums as  
currency. 
BEN 
Oh. Wallahey monta koteh. 
SUBTITLE “Red wagon wheel incest.” 
Leslie shakes her head. He got it wrong. 
LESLIE 
I know why you’re here, Ken, but I swear  
to you, I’ve tried everything. 
KEN 
Sorry, Leslie, but this is a big one.  
I’m getting a lot of pressure. I’m going  
to have to formally request that you move  
the carnival. 
BEN 
Sorry, what’s going on? 
LESLIE 
The carnival is on the site of the Battle  
of Indian Hill. It was an epic seven day  
war, that the Wamapoke eventually lost on  
account of the fact that they didn’t have  
any weapons. 
Ken refers to a MAP of the FAIRGROUNDS. * 
KEN 
During that battle, ninety-two-year-old  
Chief Wakote was shot 10 times by the  
Cavalry. And for the next week, that  
moment will be commemorated with shooting  
galleries and fried dough stands.  
LESLIE 
This is the only place in town that’s  
large enough to hold the carnival rides.  
And you know as well as I do, given  
Pawnee’s history, it’s very hard not to  
be offensive.  
 .  
 LESLIE TALKING HEAD  
Leslie stands in front of an historical map of Pawnee. The  map is tinted blue, with 1 white dots. 
LESLIE 
This is a map of all the atrocities  
Pawnee settlers inflicted on the Wamapoke  
Indians. The atrocities are in blue. 
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - D1  
LESLIE 
We put up a memorial plaque. There’s a  
huge Wamapoke exhibit in the history  
tent. We’re really trying.  
KEN 
I understand. But this is sacred ground.  
And I just hope the souls of our  
ancestors don’t put a curse on the  
festival. 
Leslie and Ben react. 
 KEN TALKING HEAD  
KEN 
There are two things I know about white  
people they love Rachael Ray, and  
they’re terrified of curses. 
10 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - CARNIVAL GROUNDS - D1 10 
A MASSIVE carnival -- rides, booths, etc. The finishing  touches are being put on by MAINTENANCE GUYS. 
11 INT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - FIRST AID TENT - LATER - D1 11 
Donna sorts through medical supplies. ANN is putting up a  poster that says “First Aid Tent.” 
DONNA 
Hey, what ever happened to you and the  
bionic man? 

Chris?(sigh) 
ANN 

He broke up with me, but he did it so  
nicely, I didn’t even realize he did it. 
 .  11  11 
DONNA 
I’ve done that to multiple men. You  
doing okay? 
ANN 
(casual) 
It’s been a little rough. Two days ago I  
was sobbing at a pizza buffet and was  
asked to leave. Been looking at dog  
adoption websites... bought seven hundred  
dollars worth of candles from  
Anthropologie -- just your basic  
“bottoming out” kind of stuff. 
Donna stares at her. 
DONNA 
Normally people will tell you to talk  
about your problems. But I’m gonna  
recommend you bottle that noise up. 

Will do. 
ANN 

1 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - FAIRGROUNDS - LATER - D1 1 
Leslie stands in front of Tom, Andy, Jerry, Ann, April and * Ron. Ben approaches Leslie. * 
BEN 
Somebody, I don’t want to say who... 
(points at himself) 
Just got Sweetums to donate another  
fifteen cotton candy machines. 
LESLIE 
Oh yeah? Take that, curse! 
BEN 
Take that, curse. 
They do a stupid handshakey thing. 
TOM 
Get a room. 
LESLIE 
Okay, everyone. Joan Callamezzo is  
bringing a camera crew here for an  
exclusive last minute walk-through of the  
Harvest Festival and we have to be  
absolutely perfect. Joan is always  
looking for a scandal. She’s like an  
eagle-eyed tiger. 

 .  1  1 
ANDY 
(super fast) 
New band name Eagle-Eyed Tiger. I  
called it. 
LESLIE 
Let’s all take each other’s hands and  
look each other in the eye. 
(they all hold hands) 
You are all amazing, wonderful people.  
So let’s relax, have fun, and not think  
about the fact that if even one tiny  
thing goes wrong we will all lose our  
jobs. 
BEN 
That’s not inspir --  
LESLIE 
Okay! Let’s get ‘em! If anyone has any  
problems, address them to Ron. 
Ron gives a thumbs up. 
1 RON TALKING HEAD 1 
RON 
The advantage of being Leslie’s boss is  
that she does everything herself, and  
there are never any problems, which means  
for the next week I can sit in a lawn  
chair and read this book about old boats. 
He holds up a “Master and Commander” book. 
RON (CONT’D) 
Excuse me, I have to get back to work. 
He sits down and starts reading. 
1 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - FAIRGROUNDS - LATER - D1 1 
JOAN CALLAMEZZO prepares for a stand-up in front of a CAMERA  CREW. Leslie and Ben approach. 
JOAN 
(vocal exercises) 
Mmmmmmmurder. Mmmmurder the most melons.  
Shaquille showers shame on Shakira’s  
sheets. 
LESLIE 
Hello, Joan. Welcome to Harvest  
Festival! 

 .  1  1 
JOAN 
Hello, Leslie. I have to say, this  
festival looks pretty impressive. 
(mutters) 
...But we’ll see. We’ll see. 
LESLIE 
Let’s get started. 
1 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - FAIRGROUNDS - LATER - D1 1 
Leslie walks with Ben, and Joan as her crew shoots. They * pass by FOOD STALLS. 
LESLIE 
The festival is spread over the entire  
town, but the carnival is really the  
centerpiece. Over there is Indiana’s  
largest corn maze. 
JOAN 
(digging) 
Is that Pawnee corn or Eagleton corn? 
LESLIE 
Pawnee corn. And it’s organic. There’s  
our beautiful Ferris Wheel -- 

Beautiful. 
JOAN 

(to camera) 
But deadly. When was this giant wheel of  
death inspected? 
BEN 
Twice in the last week. Everything is  
100 percent up to code.  
Joan looks annoyed that she hit a dead-end. 
1 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - FAIRGROUNDS - ELSEWHERE - LATER - D1 1 They look at exhibits. 

(aha) 
JOAN 

How many of the carnies are illegals? 
LESLIE 
None, Joan, they’re all U.S. residents.  Right over there is where Indiana  
basketball legend Larry Bird’s eighty four year-old Aunt Tilda will be signing  autographs for two hours, next Thursday. 

 10.  1  1
JOAN 
(genuinely impressed) 
You got Tilda? 
LESLIE 
Oh yeah. We got Tilda. But this is the  
real coup. Li’l Sebastian. 
Joan stops walking. 
JOAN 
Are you fucking kidding me? You got Li’l  
Sebastian? 
Ben looks at camera -- why the hell does everyone love this  horse so much? 
LESLIE 
See for yourself. 
Leslie points at Jerry, Tom, and Li’l Sebastian.  
JOAN 
Wow. He is so adorable. 
TOM 
Thank you, Joan! And Li’l Sebastian  
isn’t bad either! 
They laugh. Tom rubs his eyes like a cartoon character. 
TOM (CONT’D) 
Joan, did you have your breasts done?  
You look amazing! 
JOAN 
Oh, Tom, you’re so sweet.  
(to camera) 
Were you rolling on that? No? Damnit. 
(to Tom) 
Say it again later. 
TOM 
You got it. The festival’s going to  
knock your socks off. And when it does,  
I’ll be there to give you a foot massage.  
To completion. 

Good lord. 
BEN

1 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - FAIRGROUNDS - LATER - D1 1 
Ron sits in a lawn chair and reads his book. In a SPY SHOT  April and Andy play a ring toss game. 
ANDY 
Damnit. It’s like they don’t want you to  
win. 
APRIL 
You better practice. You gotta win me a  
teddy bear. 
ANDY 
I’m gonna win you a million teddy bears. 
APRIL 
Well, I want a billion teddy bears. 
ANDY 
That’s unrealistic. Two million. 

Deal. 
She kisses him. 
APRIL 
APRIL (CONT’D) 

Hey. I love you. 

...Dude. 
ANDY 

She looks at him expectantly. 
ANDY (CONT'D) 
Dude, shut up! That is awesome sauce!  
He goes to high-five April. She stares at him. 
1 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - HORSE PEN - LATER - D1 1 Jerry leads Li’l Sebastian into his pen.  
JERRY 
(calm, soothing voice) 
There you go, Li’l Sebastian. Who’s a  
good little show horse? 
Tom walks up. 
TOM 
Hey, Leslie said I should look after him  
for a bit. 

 1.  1  1 
JERRY 
Perfect. I have to go grab his tail  
scrunchie. Remember, if he starts  
vomiting, you need to clear his airway  
with two fingers, like so 
He demonstrates. Tom recoils. 
1 TOM TALKING HEAD 1 
Li’l Sebastian in the b.g. Tom holds up a HORSE BLANKET with  the Snakehole Lounge logo on it.  
TOM 
Most people look at Li’l Sebastian and  
see a cute, famous mini horse. I see an  
advertising opportunity for my club the  
Snakehole Lounge. 
He turns and looks. 
TOM (CONT’D) 
Right now, I see a shockingly huge mini horse erection. That hopefully this  
blanket will cover. 
A large PIXILATED AREA under Sebastian’s haunches will help  sell this joke. 
0 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - CARNIVAL GROUNDS - LATER - D1 0 Joan, Leslie, Ben. 
JOAN 
Well, I don’t think I’m being  
unprofessional when I say that I really  
hoped I would find more tawdry scandals.  
(idea) 
What about our friend Ben, here. We all  
know your story, of course -- a story of  
failure. Remind us of that failure. 
Ben smiles -- he’s not freaked out by this anymore. 
BEN 
When I was an eighteen year-old mayor, I  
tried to build a winter sports complex  
called Ice Town. It bankrupted the city.  
(small beat) 
I was also shortstop of my JV baseball  
team, but no one ever brings that up. 

 1.  0  0 
JOAN 
And now you’re involved with this. Do I  
smell another disaster, hopefully? 
BEN 
Joan, this festival -- thanks to the  
tireless efforts of Leslie Knope, is  
going to bring people nothing but  
happiness. Not even I could ruin this. 
Leslie and Ben exchange happy looks. 
JOAN 
Alright. I’m a reporter, not your  
therapist. 
1 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - HORSE PEN - LATER - D1 1 Tom on the phone. Jerry walks up. 
TOM 
Yeah, so every time someone takes a  
picture of him, the Snakehole’s logo will  
be in it! Am I a genius or what? 
JERRY 
Where’s Li’l Sebastian? 
Tom looks -- the PEN is OPEN, and the horse is gone. He  thinks. 
TOM 
...Somebody left the gate open and he got  
out -- Jerry! 
JERRY 
What? What are you talking about?  
 TOM TALKING HEAD  
TOM 
I have one move here. Blame Jerry. 
 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - HORSE PEN - CONTINUOUS - D1  
TOM 
Unbelievable, Jerry -- just another in a  
long string of miserable failures. 
JERRY 
I wasn’t even here! 

 1.     
TOM 
Exactly. Hopefully, I can bail you out  
of this mess that you and nobody else  
caused.  
JERRY 
You were the one watching him! 
TOM 
It’s a poor workman who blames his tools.  
You look for him -- I’ll go get help. 
He rushes off. Jerry looks stunned. 
 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - LATER - D1  
Leslie, Ben, and Joan stand in front of a GIANT COTTON CANDY  MACHINE. Joan is on camera. 
JOAN 
The Harvest Festival opens tomorrow at  
nine a.m., and as far as this reporter is  
concerned, it’s well worth your time. 
LESLIE 
Come on down, Pawnee! 
(holds up cotton candy) 
It’s going to be sweet! 
JOAN 
Okay. I’m just going to do my wrap-up. 
(sincere) 
Great work here. 
Leslie and Ben smile. Joan turns to her camera. 
LESLIE 
I’d say that went well. 
BEN 
I’d say, “take that, curse.” 
LESLIE 
Take that, curse! 
They do the handshakey thing. Joan comes back into frame. 
JOAN 
Sorry? What’s this about a “curse?” 
LESLIE 
Oh. Nothing. Nothing. Ignore that. 
Joan eyes Leslie warily. Tom rushes over. 

 1.    
TOM 
Leslie, Jerry let Li’l Sebastian escape.  
He’s gone, and we don’t know where he is. 
Joan gasps.  
JOAN 
Get those cameras up. We’re doing a new  
intro.(quietly to Leslie) 
Gotcha. 
Off of Leslie’s look... 
END OF ACT ONE 
 1.  
ACT TWO 
 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - CARNIVAL GROUNDS - LATER - D1  Joan is finishing. 
JOAN 
Is it the revenge of the Wamapoke? An  
incompetent government run amok? Or,  
probably, something even worse than those  
things? While it seemed everything was  
ready for tomorrow, things may not be  
exactly what they seem. 
She nods happily at her excellent work. 
JOAN (CONT'D) 
Nailed it. Let’s start getting shots of  
chipped paint, crying kids, spooky  
traffic lights -- you know the drill.  
 INT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - HQ TENT - LATER - D1  
A HUGE tent set up as on-site HQ for the carnival. Leslie  and Ben. 
BEN 
This is bad, right? 
LESLIE 
Bad? We’ve just been hit by a giant poop  
tornado. A poopnado. 
BEN 
Okay, well, gross, but we can deal with  
bad publicity. 
LESLIE 
It’s way more than that. This is a huge  
government project -- it’s already a  
lightning rod. Add in controversy with  
the Wamapoke -- double lightning rod. 
BEN 
Plus, we’ve already lost a a miniature  
living legend. 
LESLIE 
Triple lightning rod! Throw in “the  
curse.” Quadruple lightning rod. It’s a  
classic four-rod disaster. Vendors will  
bail, ticket sales will drop-- 

 1.     
BEN 
I’m sorry, do people in this town really  
believe in curses? 
 LESLIE TALKING HEAD  
Leslie stands in front of a mural of a man clutching a white  rabbit. 
LESLIE 
Pawnee is an incredibly superstitious  
town. Once, a traveling magician pulled  
a rabbit out of his hat and a mob burned  
him at the stake for being a witch. 
WIDEN TO REVEAL The magician is being roasted. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
The year was 1. 
WIDEN FURTHER TO REVEAL Everyone is in bell bottoms and they  are driving 0s cars. 
 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - LATER - D1  * 
April, Tom, and Andy watch as Jerry paces, clearly  
distressed.  
JERRY 
We’re up the creek, here! What the heck  
are we gonna do now?!  
Ron, still reading, tries to ignore the argument. 
TOM 
You mean what are you gonna do. 
JERRY 
No, what are do gonna you? 
TOM 
What am “do” going to I? Good question,  
genius. 
(to Ron) 
Can you believe we left Li’l Sebastian  
with this guy? 
JERRY 
You were the one watching him! 
Ron SIGHS loudly and closes his book.  

 1.     
RON 
Well, apparently I’m not gonna get any  
work done. How did this happen? 
APRIL 
Maybe Li’l Sebastian got upset because he  
tried to share his true feelings with  
someone. And they didn’t reciprocate. 

(nods) 
ANDY 

Maybe. Or maybe a balloon popped  somewhere and that scared him?  
RON 
Let’s split up. Tom, Jerry -- check the  field behind the parking lot.  
TOM 
I don’t wanna go with Jerry. He’s the  one who deliberately caused me to  accidentally let that horse out.  (chanting) 
Jerry’s fault! Jerry’s fault! 

Stop it! 
JERRY RON 

Andy, April -- check the corn maze. 
ANDY 
Good thinking, horses love mazes.  
 INT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - HQ TENT - LATER - D1  Ann and Leslie. 
ANN 
Hey, one of the carnies came into the  
first aid tent because he felt dizzy, and  
then a reporter came in and asked me if  
it’s because of “the curse.”  
LESLIE 
No comment! Say “no comment!” 

I did. 
ANN 
LESLIE 

You’re the best. Treat him, release him,  and don’t say anything to anyone about  anything, for the rest of the month. 

 1.     
BEN 
Leslie? You need to see this. 
Ben is watching TV. PERD HAPLEY interviews Ken Hotate. 
KEN (ON TV) 
Look, I don’t want to say if there is or  
isn’t a “curse.” But the fact is, this  
carnival is located on top of an ancient  
Wamapoke site.  
PERD HAPLEY (ON TV) 
Much like the house in the movie  
“Poltergeist.” 
KEN (ON TV) 
Exactly -- facts. My ancestors died  
there, and now it’s filled with toy  
shooting galleries and port-o-potties. I  
asked Leslie Knope from the Parks  
Department to move the carnival, and she  
refused.  
PERD HAPLEY (ON TV) 
We have an animation of that event --  
let’s take a look. 
We see one of those TAIWANESE NEWS ANIMATIONS, like they did  for the Tiger Woods accident, featuring weird video game  likenesses of people recreating events. 
BEN 
Oh -- I love these things! 
She looks at him angrily. 

Sorry. 
BEN (CONT’D) 

In the animation, a BLONDE LADY is approached by a MAN  looking like Ken. She adamantly shakes her head “no,” and  sticks out her tongue at him.  
BEN (CONT’D) 
How did they have time to make this?  
It’s literally in -D. 
In the animation the video game Ken starts dancing around,  chanting, and some GHOSTS and SPIRITS fly around and start  swarming the Blonde Lady -- one of them FLIES INTO HER BODY  and her face becomes DEMONIC and SCARY. CHYRON Leslie  Knope.

PERD HAPLEY (ON TV) 
Is that what happened? 
KEN (ON TV) 
...Yes. That’s exactly what happened. 
PERD HAPLEY (ON TV)

Check back in with News Channel .  
Number one in Curse Coverage. 
An elaborate “curse” graphic outros the piece. 
LESLIE  
All right. I think we should move the  
shooting gallery. It’s clearly their  
biggest issue -- maybe that’ll be enough. 
BEN 
It’s gonna be expensive to move that  
thing. Can we afford it? 
LESLIE 
(dramatic) 
No. But what we really can’t afford is  
not it. 
0 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - CORN MAZE - LATER - D1 0 April and Andy search for the horse. 
ANDY 
Hey, you know where I would hide if I  
were a horse? The merry-go-round. Just  
stand really still, next to the other  
horses. No one would ever find you. The  
perfect crime. 
April rolls her eyes. 
APRIL 
I’m gonna go look by myself. 
ANDY 
Hey, are you okay? I feel like you’re  
being super not happy right now. 
APRIL 
I’m fine. Oh, I forgot to tell you -- I  
might be going to Venezuela tomorrow,  
forever. 

 1.  0  0 
ANDY 
...You’re not fine. I can read you like  
the back of a book -- you’re upset about  
something. Why won’t you tell me what it  
is?

I’m not upset. I’m great. See? 
She smiles broadly. He stares at her, suspicious.

Ann uses a flashlight to look into the eyes of KILEY, the  carny who passed out, who’s a kind of Jersey Shore-type dude.  Donna is nearby. 
KILEY 
I don’t know what’s sicker me or your  
body. 
ANN 
You aren’t sick. 
KILEY 
Oh, I’m not? You may wanna check out my  
abs. 
ANN 
Are you experiencing abdominal pain? 
He lifts up his shirt. 
KILEY 
Every day, at the gym. Feel. 

(lame) 
ANN 

Ew.(feeling his abs, impressed) 
Oh! 
KILEY 
What are you doing tonight? 
ANN 
Prepping the medical tent. 

 .    
KILEY 
I mean in terms of us. 
ANN 
I think I’m gonna have to pass. 
She walks off. Donna grabs her. 
DONNA 
You gonna hit that? 
ANN 
Him? He doesn’t really seem like  
boyfriend material. 
DONNA 
Who said anything about “boyfriend”?  
“Use him. Abuse him. Lose him.” That’s  
the Meagle motto. 
Ann considers that. 
 DONNA TALKING HEAD  
DONNA 
Grammie Meagle taught me that. She died  
in bed at age eighty-four. Sandwiched

JERRY 
Did you find him? 
APRIL 
Yeah, he’s right here in my pocket.  
RON 
Damnit. Okay, he can’t have gone that  
far. He has the legs of Tom, the  
endurance of Jerry, and the diseases of  
Jerry. Ground mission failed. We need a  
bird’s eye view. 
He eyes the Ferris Wheel.

 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - HQ TENT - EVENING - NIGHT 1  * 
Fifteen members of the press are arrayed in front of a  lectern. Leslie prepares at the lectern. Ben gives a quote  to a REPORTER. 
BEN 
We’re extremely confident that there is  
no curse, and that everyone will have a  
great time tomorrow. 
REPORTER 
Thanks. Wow -- first Ice Town, now this.  
Bad luck really follows you around, huh? 
Ben takes that in. Leslie begins the press conference. 
LESLIE 
I’d like to start by addressing some  
false rumors about the festival. 
(reading) 
We have plenty of food -- there is no  
food shortage. There are not, as one  
report suggested, “dozens of escaped  
convicts meandering around the carnival.”  
And at no time was any Parks Department  
worker, quote, “feasting on the petting  
zoo animals.” Joan? 
JOAN 
Leslie, how big a disaster will this be,  
on a scale of nine to ten?  
LESLIE 
The festival is going to be a huge  
success. And just to be extra sensitive  
to our Wamapoke friends, we have moved  
the shooting gallery, as they requested. 
Yes, Perd?  
PERD HAPLEY 
The statement this reporter wants to make  
is a question will that be enough to  
lift the curse? 
LESLIE 
Perd, you know as well as I do, that in  
reality--  
The lights BLACK OUT. People murmur. 
JOAN 
The power is out! It’s the curse! 

 .    
The emergency lights click ON. 
LESLIE 
Crrrrap on a spatula. Don’t worry,  
everyone -- just stay calm. 
 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - LATER - N1  Ron, Jerry, Tom, and April are on the Ferris Wheel.  
ANDY 
I’m only gonna say this once, but, what  
if Li’l Sebastian is on this Ferris  
Wheel? Perfect crime, part two. 
The Ferris wheel grinds to a halt and everything goes dark. 
TOM 
Jerry, what the hell? 
JERRY 
Sorry, guys. 
(beat) 
Hey, no -- wait a second! 
 EXT. HARVEST FESTIVAL - PRESS CONFERENCE AREA - LATER - N1  Leslie huddles with Ben. 
LESLIE 
God, we cannot catch a break. 
BEN 
I gotta go. I’m sorry. I feel like I’m  
jinxed. 

What? 
LESLIE BEN 

You were totally fine until I got  
involved -- everything I touch turns to  Ice Town. I’m sorry. I’m the curse. 
Ben leaves. Leslie stares after him.  END OF ACT TWO

How is that possible? I got the TMK 00, specifically for its extra  
capacity. 
ED 
Wow. You know your stuff. You single? 
LESLIE 
Not now, Ed. What caused this? 
ED 
You would’ve been fine, but all those TV  
crews plugged in and overloaded it.  
LESLIE 
I knew it. Stupid media. Freedom of the  
press is for the birds. 
(gathers herself) 
Where can I get a new one in, oh, now? 
ED 
There’s only one place in town with a  
generator that size.

Okay well, you’re all set. You’re free  
to go.

TOM 
Well, if that’s true, then you’re going  
to have to answer to this whole town.  
And God. 
JERRY 
You were the one who let him out and you  
know it! Stop trying to blame it on me! 
APRIL 
Jerry, can you be quiet? I can’t hear  
myself not talking to Andy. 

 .     
ANDY 
Ron, could you ask April why she’s mad at  
me? 
APRIL 
Ron, could you tell Andy, “Awesome  
sauce.” 
RON 
All of you be quiet. Andy she’s mad  
because you said “awesome sauce” instead  
of “I love you, too.” April he loves  
you, stop being a child. Tom, you’re  
clearly at fault here -- blaming Jerry  
won’t save you. Jerry, we both know you  
were shotgunning funnel cakes instead of  
watching Li’l Sebastian. So, everyone  
apologize to everyone else. 
They all mumble “sorrys.” 
ANDY 
I do love you. For real. 

You do?

Yeah. That’s what makes the sauce so  
awesome.

Please, Ken. I am coming to you on my  
knees, begging for help, just as the  
first settlers of Pawnee begged the  
Wamapoke two hundred years ago. 
KEN

slaughtered. I know. But this is no  

trick.

was cursed. Ice Town and now this. 
LESLIE 
Look -- Ice Town was a disaster and it  
was probably your fault. Seems like you  
mismanaged the hell out of it.

But this is as much your project as it is  
mine, and it’s gonna be great. You

ANDY 
Okay, let me just look for the form.

There’s no time! He can fly! 
JUMP CUT 
A bunch of EXTRAS YELL at Andy and generally behave poorly. JUMP CUT 
Andy talks to LOUISE. 
LOUISE 
So I sign here? 
ANDY 
I think -- ow -- here. Ow. 
REVEAL A KID is punching Andy in the leg. 
LOUISE 
Henry! Stop it! 

Cute kid. 
ANDY 

Ron pokes his head out and sees Andy getting punched. 
RON 
Andy? Got a sec? 
1 INT. RON’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - D 1 Andy walks in. 
ANDY 
You wanted to see me? 
RON 
Why are you working the permits desk, and  
why was that child punching your nuggets?  
ANDY 
I’m trying to keep April from taking a  
job with Chris, so I’m doing everything  
she hates doing for a month. 
RON 
That’s going to work? 
ANDY 
She said it might. It’s all I’ve got,  
man. 
Ron chews his moustache. 

 1.   1  1 
RON 
Gimme the list. I’ll help you. 
ANDY 
Seriously?! Oh my God -- thank you so  
much! 
Andy HUGS Ron, who tolerates it. 
0 RON TALKING HEAD 0 
RON 
No. I don’t care about their  
relationship. I just don’t want to lose  
April. I’d never be able to find a worse  
assistant.  
1 INT. RADIO STATION - LATER - D 1 Ben sits motionless. Leslie and Tom try to console him.  
TOM 
Hey, nice job, man. Was that your first  
time talking to other people? Because it  
came off that way. 
BEN 
Sorry, guys. I haven’t had to deal with  
that mayor stuff for seventeen years. I  
guess I’m not totally over it. 
LESLIE 
No worries, Ben! Bump in the road, but  
fortunately, the Leslie-mobile is an all terrain vehicle.  
(to Tom) 
So -- everything involving Ben is fine.  
But I need to talk to you in private,  
about something different, that’s not Ben related. Ben -- good job! 
TOM 
Smoothly done. 
 INT. RADIO STATION - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER - D  Tom and Leslie whisper. 
TOM 
Your boy’s a nightmare! 

 1.     
LESLIE 
I know, but we need him. Having someone  
from the state government gives us  
credibility. Plus if there’s a budget  
question, he’s our numbers guy. 
TOM 
We should just slap a pair of Ray Ban’s  
on a calculator -- that would be way more  
charming. 
LESLIE 
Well, sure, that would be adorable. We  
could put a tiny Hawaiian shirt on it,  
and call him “Mike Ro-chip.” But let’s  
focus I’ll handle the newspaper  
interview. You and Ben do Channel Four.  
Perd Hapley’s a big softie -- it’ll be a  
ten-minute puff piece. He’ll be fine. 
They LOOK OVER at Ben. The Douche is talking to him. 
THE DOUCHE 
So, what do you think of Pawnee? 
BEN 
(completely flustered again) 
I... there’s a lot of... cars. I mean,  
not too many. Also, trucks. 
THE DOUCHE  
...Cool. Good talk, buddy. 
The Douche sips his ENERGY DRINK and walks off. Off Leslie  and Tom. Yikes.

ACT TWO 
 INT. RON’S OFFICE - LATER - D  Andy and Ron. 
RON 
What’s the next task? 
ANDY 
We have to write her grandmother a thank you note for a birthday check. It has to  
be really good too, since it’s five  
months late. 
RON 
Never written a thank-you note before.  
This’ll be fun.  
Ron loads paper into his typewriter. 
RON (CONT’D) 
Dear... what does she call her? 
ANDY 
Gamma? Nanna? Gizmo? Something like  
that. 
RON 
I’ll just type “Dear,” and then a line,  
and she can write it in by hand. 

Right on. 
ANDY 

 INT. TOM’S CAR - LATER - D  Tom drives with Ben. 
TOM 
Before we do this next interview, there’s  
a little secret I want to let you in on.  
It’s called the Haverford Schmooze. 
BEN 
I was just caught off-guard. I’m fine. 
TOM 
(ignores him) 
Three easy steps Smile. Friendly  
physical contact. And flattery. “Perd --  
was your dad Robocop? Because your arms  
are guns!” 

 1.      
BEN 
Robocop didn’t have guns for arms. 
TOM 
Oh my God, so not the point, nerd. 
They pull into a shopping center parking lot. 
BEN 
Where are we going? 
TOM 
We’re getting you a new suit. I’ve let  
this go on long enough.  
BEN 
I like this suit. 
TOM 
You shouldn’t.  
Tom stops the car and gets out. 
 INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - AFTERNOON - D  Ann and Chris eat a meal. 
CHRIS 
Who knew watercress, garbanzo beans, and  
walnuts could compliment each other so  
well? 
ANN 
Good dressing too, right? Flaxseed and  
agave. Same basic ingredients as bird  
feed! 

Amazing. 
CHRIS 

Chris takes a long look around the room. 
CHRIS (CONT’D) 
Hey, I’m just going to come out and say  
this I’d like to define your bagua. 
ANN 
(totally on board) 
Okay! What is that?! 
CHRIS 
It’s a feng shui term. The energy in  
this house is pretty stale.  
(MORE) 

 1.      CHRIS (CONT'D) 
I can help you redefine your flow in a  
really positive way.  
ANN 
Great. I’m really not attached to the  
way this stuff is arranged. Or the stuff  
itself. Or this house, really, even. 
Ann tries to see if Chris gets her meaning. 
CHRIS 
Let’s do it! 
 ANN TALKING HEAD  In the b.g., Chris rearranges her furniture. 
ANN 
Am I not being obvious enough? I feel  
like I’m being obvious. 
 INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER - D  April sits at her desk. Andy walks in and hands her a note. 
ANDY 
This is for your gizmo. I think you’ll  
find it’s “pretty good.” 
APRIL 
Well, let’s see. “Dear April’s  
Grandmother.” I said grandfather.  
ANDY 
Oops. Okay. 
APRIL 
“You are a beautiful and amazing woman.”  
Man. “I hope someday I can become half  
the woman you are.” He’s a man. “Thank  
you for the five hundred dollars.” It  
was five dollars. “Enjoy the Mouse Rat  
CD.” He is deaf.  
She hands it back to him. 
ANDY 
Do you... want me to make those changes?  
Or is this okay? I’ll make the changes. 
 INT. LESLIE AND TOM’S OFFICE - LATER - D  Leslie and SHAUNA MALWAE-TWEEP. 

 1.      
LESLIE 
This just in Harvest Festival will be  
Harvest Bestival! Parks Department  
planted the seeds, now they’re harvesting 
the rewards! 
SHAUNA 
Great! You done? 
LESLIE 
“They’ll put the ‘fun’ in ‘funnel cake!’”  
Now I’m done. 
SHAUNA 
Cool. Let’s get started. 
Shauna HITS RECORD on her tape recorder. 
 SHAUNA TALKING HEAD  
SHAUNA 
You have to let Leslie get all her  
suggested headlines out of her system  
before you start the interview. 
0 INT. LESLIE AND TOM’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - D 0 
SHAUNA 
So, let’s talk about Ben Wyatt. 
LESLIE 
(uh-oh) 
...Sure! Ben works for the state  
government, and he has been advising us  
on our budget. 
SHAUNA 
Come on, Leslie. The Douche blew this  
story wide open. Ben Wyatt bankrupts a  
town and then comes to Pawnee to tell us  
how to spend our money?  
LESLIE 
There’s no story here, Shauna. He’s a  
dedicated civil servant who is doing  
everything he can to make this the best  
Harvest Festival ever.  
Beat as Shauna scribbles. Leslie fills the silence. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
(joking) 
And he’s easy on the eyes, too. 

 0.   0  0 
Shauna is delighted. Leslie knows she stepped in it. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
Wait, you asked me about Colin Powell,  
right? That’s who we were talking about? 
SHAUNA 
We were talking about Ben Wyatt. What  
exactly is the nature of your  
relationship with him? 
LESLIE 
Strictly professional. Friends. 
SHAUNA 
So are you colleagues or are you friends? 
LESLIE 
Colleagues with benefits.  
(oh boy) 
We’re colleagues who have the benefit of  
also being friends.  
(checks watch) 
Sorry, Shauna. We have to wrap this up.  
As always, this was all off the record.  
Thanks, bye! 
She walks out of her own office. 
1 INT. RON’S OFFICE - LATER - D 1 Andy walks in with a box of mail, and hands Ron a camera. 
ANDY 
Okay, the next thing is... a photography  
class assignment. Can you figure this  
out? 
RON 
(reading) 
“Encapsulate the spirit of melancholy.”  
So, “take pictures of sad things.” Easy.  
He snaps random photos. 
RON (CONT’D) 
Boom -- a sad desk. Boom -- sad wall. 
(then) 
It’s art. Anything is anything. 

Right on.  
ANDY

Sad floor. 
RON 
ANDY 

(genuinely) 
Awwww. It does look sad, kind of. Sorry  
for standing on you, floor. 
Donna clocks what’s going on. 
 INT. HALLWAY - LATER - D  Donna tracks down April. 
DONNA 
Hey. You got Andy doing all your work  
for you? 
APRIL 
Yeah. He said he wanted to do it, and  
I’m getting him back for kissing Ann-- 
DONNA 
Yeah, I don’t care. I got something to  
add to your list. 
 INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER - D  
Andy sits across from Donna. Her foot is on his knee, and he  is MASSAGING HER FEET. 
DONNA 
Yup. There we go. That’s the stuff. 
ANDY 
April does this every day? 
DONNA 
Yup. Work the heel. 
Andy works away. April watches him. Jerry walks up. 
JERRY 
Can I be next?

 INT. NBC  STUDIOS - “YA’ HEARD WITH PERD” SET - LATER - D  
Tom and Ben sit down opposite PERD HAPLEY, who is being  worked on a by a TEAM of make-up artists and hair and  wardrobe people. 
TOM 
Just remember Smile, touch, flatter.  
Follow my lead. 
A STAGE MANAGER counts them down. 
STAGE MANAGER 
In five, four, three, two... 
PERD HAPLEY 
Welcome to “Ya’ Heard with Perd.” I’m  
Perd Hapley. The story of our guests  
today is that they are from the  
Department of Parks and Recreation. Ben  
Wyatt and Tom Haverford. 
Tom fist-bumps Perd. 
TOM 
Hi, Perd. Big fan. 
BEN 
Me too, Perd. 
Ben smiles. 
PERD HAPLEY 
The thing about this first question, is  
that I’d like to ask you about the  
Harvest Festival. Mr. Wyatt, how exactly  
is Pawnee paying for this, after our  
budget crisis? 
BEN 
The money is largely coming from local  
sponsors, and a special reserve fund.  
We’re taking on no new debt.  
TOM 
And Perd, it’s going to be amazing.  
Carnival rides, games -- Sweetums is  
helping build a plus-sized roller  
coaster, for Pawnee’s obese thrill seekers. 
(holds hands out) 
You must be this wide to ride! 
Ben smiles -- everything is going well. 
 .   
 INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER - D  Everyone works. Ben and Tom arrive in the bullpen. 
LESLIE 
Hey! How’d it go? 
BEN 
...It went okay I think. 
TOM 
Are you insane? 
BEN 
Well, there were some sticky moments... 
TOM 
(waving a DVD) 
Let’s go to the videotape. 
 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - D  
April, Ron, Leslie, Tom, Ben, Jerry, and Donna watch the  interview. Ben, on TV, is FLOP-SWEATING and completely  jittery.  
BEN (ON TV) 
Well, I mean, who hasn’t had gay  
thoughts? 
PERD HAPLEY (ON TV) 
Are you okay? 
BEN (ON TV) 
I’m fine. I mean, I think I might need  
glasses.  
(looking around) 
Is there a bird in here? I keep thinking  
I see a bird. Bird, and Perd -- that’s  
weird. Or, it’s not weird, it just  
rhymes. But that’s okay, man -- a ton of  
stuff rhymes. 
In the conference room, Ben shakes his head in astonishment. 
LESLIE 
How did this happen? 
TOM 
He was fine until Perd asked him about  
the “Boy Mayor” thing. Then shit got  
weird in a hurry. 
(then, pointing to screen) 
Watch this. What is this?! 

 .     
ON TV Ben smiles widely, stares at Perd without blinking,  tightly holds onto Perd’s arm for several seconds, then  laughs maniacally. Perd looks terrified. 
LESLIE 
You look psychotic. 
JERRY 
I don’t think it’s that bad. 
TOM 
Jerry says it’s okay. I guess it’s okay. 
BEN (ON TV) 
Look, I was eighteen when I was elected  
mayor. Cindy Eckert had just turned me  
down for senior prom. I should call her!  
No, I shouldn’t. 
Tom presses stop on the DVD player. 
TOM 
Then for five minutes he talks about  
feeling up Cindy Eckert for the first  
time. And then the show ended. As did  
our careers and probably Harvest Fest. 
DONNA 
(to Ben) 
At least your suit was pimp. 
No one knows what to say. Ben looks incredibly sad. Ron  SNAPS A PICTURE of him. 
RON 
Boom. Sadness. That’s the one.

ACT THREE 
 INT. ANDY’S FRIEND’S VAN - LATE AFTERNOON - D  
Andy screeches into the parking lot of a school. NATALIE is  the only kid waiting. 
ANDY 
(waving maniacally) 
Natalie! It’s me, Andy, from being your  
sister’s friend. She sent me to pick you up.  
NATALIE 
You’re an hour and a half late. 
ANDY 
I know, I had to massage a ton of feet,  
I’m super sorry. Please just get in -- I  
have to do everything on April’s list or  
she won’t go out with me. 
NATALIE 
You’re into April? 
(beat) 
Hold on. I have to get my books. 
Natalie walks over to a security guard and says something to  him. The cop walks over to Andy’s van. 
SECURITY GUARD 
Sir, are you trying to lure this girl  
into your van? 
ANDY 
Yes. But she’s being really difficult.  
Also, it’s not my van -- I kind of stole  
it from my friend. Technically, I’m not  
supposed to be driving it -- my license  
is crazy expired.  
The Security Guard stares at him.  
ANDY (CONT’D) 
Can you do me a favor and just force her  
to get in my van, officer? 
 INT. LESLIE AND TOM’S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING - D  Leslie, Ben, and Tom. Leslie is on the phone. 
LESLIE 
(into phone) 
Thank you so much. 

 .     
She hangs up. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
The mayor’s office is going to try to do  
damage control on the Perd thing. Tom?  
How we doing? 
TOM 
I’ve gotten calls from a dozen businesses  
who are thinking about pulling their  
sponsorships. Sweetums might cancel the  
Fat-Coaster! 
LESLIE 
Oh God. Okay, we need to focus -- we  
still have the Pawnee Today interview. 
BEN 
Is it too late to cancel? 
LESLIE 
Joan Callamezzo owns this town. If we  
screw her over, she’ll ruin us. But Ben,  
you’re not going in front of the cameras.  
BEN 
Fine with me. 
TOM 
Are you sure, Leslie? Then how’s he  
going to ruin everything? Hey I know --  
why don’t you walk around the studio,  
flinging buckets of acid at people? That  
would actually be less harmful then what  
you’ve done so far. 
Ben looks sad. 
 EXT. SCHOOL - LATER - D  
Andy sits on the curb, hands behind his back in plastic wrist ties. The guard reads Andy’s driver’s license information  into his walkie-talkie. 
SECURITY GUARD 
(into radio) 
D-w-y-e-r. 
ANDY 
Dude, come on. I have to get out of  
here. Natalie -- tell him that you know  
me! 
Natalie giggles and takes a cell phone picture of him.

0 INT. PAWNEE TODAY STUDIOS - LATER - D 0 Leslie sits. Tom talks to JOAN CALLAMEZZO. 
TOM 
Every single day, you get hotter. I do not  
understand it. I was watching your show  
last week and my TV shorted out. You’re  
too hot for my plasma. You’re so hot, you  
make me want to wear a looser pant. 
JOAN 
(delighted) 
Stop it. I have to prep for this  
interview. 
TOM 
Damn girl, you got brains and butt.  
Let’s make a pact if both of us are  
still single in an hour, let’s get  
married. 
JOAN 
I’m already married, Tom. 
TOM 
That’s right -- to Jay-Z. No? Oh -- I  
guess I confused you with Beyoncè again. 
She giggles uncontrollably. The OPENING MUSIC STARTS, and  Tom steps down off the stage and looks at Ben like, “See how  easy it is?” 
JOAN 
Welcome to Pawnee Today. I’m Joan  
Callamezzo. Today’s guest is Leslie Knope,  
who will explain how this year’s Harvest  
Festival is going to bankrupt the city. 
LESLIE 
Joan, there’s a lot of false information  
flying around. The Harvest Festival-- 
JOAN 
Well, you’re just jumping right in,  
aren’t you? Rude.  
LESLIE 
Well, it’s important that people know how  
truly extraordinary this is going to be. 

 .   0  0 
JOAN 
But at what cost? How many more towns  
does Ben Wyatt have to destroy before  
he’s put behind bars?!  
Behind the cameras, Ben rubs his forehead and starts to slink  away. Leslie notices. 
LESLIE 
That’s... not accurate. Ben Wyatt has  
done nothing wrong. 
(then) 
You know what? Screw it. You want to  
ask questions about Ben’s past or  
present, go crazy. Ben, get up here.  
Ben shakes his head. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
Yes, Ben. Let’s do this. “Shop ‘Til You  
Drop” interview with Ben Wyatt starts  
now. Ask him whatever you want, and  
we’ll clear this up once and for all.  
She motions to him again, and he sees that she means  business. Ben reluctantly takes the stage. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
Here we go. Caller? Go ahead.  
CALLER # 
Yeah, how can you justify raising taxes  
for something that will hurt the town?  
Ben freezes. Leslie stares at him encouragingly. 
BEN 
(stammering) 
Because I... It won’t... Look... 
LESLIE 
Well, to add to what Ben is stammering  
we will not be raising taxes, at all.  
Next caller? 
1 INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER - D 1 
SPY SHOT April sits at her desk. Ron pops out of his office  with his coffee cup. 
RON 
Do you fish, April? 

 .   1  1 
APRIL 
No. Fish are gross. 
RON 
Let me give you a piece of fishing  
advice. 
APRIL 
I said I don’t-- 
RON 
When you have a fish on the line, you  
don’t just drag it behind the boat. You  
either reel it in, or cut the line.  
Especially if he’s a nice fish, with a  
big, lovable fish heart.  
APRIL 
You don’t know what you’re talking about. 
RON 
Maybe not. Maybe you really do hate  
Andy. Maybe moving to Indianapolis  
just to get revenge on him is a good 
idea. What do I know. 
He sips his coffee and walks back into his office. April  thinks. Her CELL PHONE beeps and she looks at it -- it’s a  picture of Andy in handcuffs. 
 EXT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - EVENING - NIGHT   Chris and Ann sit, drinking glasses of weird tea. 
CHRIS 
Verosian tea really supercharges the  
bacteria in your colon. Plus, it smells  
interesting! Waft it! 
Ann wafts it into her nose. 
ANN 
Are we actually going to drink it at some  
point, or do we just sniff it? I love  
sniffing it, don’t get me wrong. 
CHRIS 
Hilarious! We definitely drink it. 
He sips from a glass. Ann takes a deep breath. 
ANN 
So... you’re leaving soon. 

 0.      
CHRIS 
Yes. Back to Indianapolis briefly, then  
onto a town called Snerling, Indiana for  
several months. 
ANN 
Never heard of it. 
CHRIS 
It’s quite small. The cows outnumber the  
people forty to one! It sounds amazing. 
ANN 
Well... I like you a lot. I love  
spending time with you. 
Chris smiles. 
CHRIS 
I thoroughly enjoy you, Ann Perkins. Our  
chemistry is inarguably dynamite. 
ANN 
Good. But we need to talk about what  
this means for us. I don’t want to be  
clingy... 
CHRIS 
Say no more. The only reason I haven’t  
brought it up is because I don’t like  
thinking about being away from you. But  
we do need to figure it out, and we  
should do that right now! 
ANN 
I’m really glad to hear you say that. 
(drinks) 
Wow, this is disgusting. 
CHRIS 
Yes, it’s very hard to drink. 
 INT. PAWNEE TODAY STUDIOS - LATER - N  Still going. 
CALLER # 
Why should we trust this Ben Wyatt guy?  
Ben sweats. Leslie gives him a reassuring look. 

 1.

Um. Well. Because I’m trustworthy. I  
am working very hard to make sure this  
town gets back on its feet. 
LESLIE

You should be in jail. 

Why? 
BEN 
CALLER # 

I don’t know. I just heard Joan say it.  
Love you, Joan! 
JOAN 
Love you, too! 
LESLIE 
Next caller. 
CALLER # 
So, I looked you up on AltaVista and I  
found out that the last seven towns you  
have gone to ended up bankrupt. 
BEN 
First of all, why does everyone in this  
town use AltaVista? Second, I’m a budget  
specialist. I went to those towns because 
they were bankrupt, and now they aren’t.  
And yeah, I screwed up when I was eighteen - 
- who doesn’t do dumb things when they’re  
eighteen? Joan? 
JOAN 
I stole my gym teacher’s husband. 
BEN 
So, there you go.  
Leslie smiles. 
LESLIE 
What else you got, callers? Anything? 
Going once, going twice... 
JOAN 
Here’s one. Go ahead. 

 .      
CALLER # 
Yeah, hi. Um, can you tell me more about  
the corn maze at the Harvest Festival?  
Are dogs allowed?  
Leslie and Ben smile at each other. 
 INT. SHOESHINE HALLWAY - LATER - N  Andy, exhausted, closes up his stand. April approaches. 
APRIL 
How was it? 
ANDY 
Super good. Everything went great.  
APRIL 
...It did, huh? 
ANDY 
Yup. You have the list for tomorrow? 
APRIL 
You... want to do this again tomorrow? 
ANDY 
(”duh”) 
Yeah. Of course. And the next day, and  
the next day -- I gotta do the full  
month. That’s the deal, right? I gotta  
prove that we--  
April grabs Andy and kisses him. Andy is shocked. 
APRIL 
I better be the only person you kissed today. 
ANDY 
...I’m positive you are, but I want to  
just triple-make-sure... 
They kiss again. Jerry walks up to them. 
JERRY 
Oh, hey, Andy. Do you think I could get  
that foot massage now? 
Shut up, Jerry.ANDY

Shut up, Jerry. 

Andy and April look at each other and kiss again. END OF ACT THREE

BEN (ON TV) 
This is a birthmark, Perd. Okay? And  
this is a little scar I got when I fell  
off my bike when I was nine, so, no, I’m  
not perfect. 
TOM 
I can’t look away. 
LESLIE 
I know. It’s really amazing. 
REVEAL Ben is also there, happily watching it with them.

Wait wait -- this is the best part. 
PERD HAPLEY (ON TV) 
That’s all the time we have on “Ya’

LESLIE 
“Safe Halloween” PSA, take one. 
(to cameras) 
Hey, kids! The Parks Department wants  
you to have fun on Halloween. But we  
also believe that “trick or treat”  
doesn’t have to mean “sick or hurt.” 
(trying to make it rhyme) 
“Sick or hur-eeet.” Rhymes with  
“treat.” Okay. Let’s watch this skit  
I’ve written, and copyrighted, about  
Halloween safety. 
JERRY, APRIL, and TOM walk on stage. Tom and April are  playing trick-or-treaters, Leslie is their mom.  
TOM 
“Hey, Diane. Don’t you love  
Halloween, especially when we act  
responsibly?” 
APRIL 
“Yes, Jeremy. I do.” 
LESLIE 
“Okay, kids. Just one more house, and  
then it’s time to go home.” 
Tom realizes something. Looks at Leslie. 
TOM 
Mommy? Why do I look so different  
from you? And my sister?  
LESLIE 
(hushed) 
Stick to the script. 
TOM 
I can’t when I’m so confused about who  
I am. I need my backstory, for the  
character of “Jeremy.” 
LESLIE 
(takes deep breath) 
Okay, um... Diane’s father, my first  
husband, passed away, in a war.  
(MORE)
 .   LESLIE (CONT'D) 
And then I married your father, who’s  
Libyan.  
APRIL 
My dad died? You said he was training  
to be an astronaut! 
LESLIE 
Just... back on script! Both of you! 
(calling off) 
We can edit this all out, right,  
Billy? 
An EXTRA off-camera nods, bored. They ring a doorbell. 
TOM/APRIL 
Trick or treat. 
JERRY 
Hello, kids! Do you want some candy? 
APRIL 
No. I’m too sad. I just found out my  
dad is dead. 
JERRY 
(at a loss) 
...Okay. Well. Here’s some candy. 
He hands them a CANDY BAR with a GIANT BLADE sticking out of  it. Tom has clearly never seen this prop before and LAUGHS. 
TOM 
Whoa! What’s up, Creepsville? Did  
you lose your machete? Because  
there’s a machete sticking out of this  
Kit Kat. 
APRIL 
What are you talking about, Jeremy? I  
don’t see anything wrong with that.  
I’m going to eat it. 
JERRY 
(improvising; creepy) 
Yesssssss... eat it! 
LESLIE 
God Jerry, don’t be such a ham. 
(re candy bar) 
We’d better just throw this away and  
report the incident to the police. 
(MORE)
 .   LESLIE (CONT'D)
(to April and Tom) 
So kids, what did we learn? 
TOM 
(to camera) 
If you want to hide a sharp object in  
candy, make sure you use a small  
blade. 

No. 
LESLIE 
APRIL 
(big smile) 

Or use poison! 

Stop it. 
LESLIE TOM

ACT ONE 
INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER - D1 
Leslie stands in the hallway, arms folded, calmly looking for  someone as KIDS filter past her. Suddenly she sees him GREG  PIKITIS. 1. Ultra-cocky. Leslie’s worst nightmare. 
LESLIE 
Greg Pikitis. 
He looks over, smirks, walks up to her. He’s eating a PEACH. 
GREG 
You’re the Parks lady, right? 
LESLIE 
That’s right. I’m the Parks lady.  
Leslie Knope. And I’m here to tell  
you that this year, it ends. 

What ends? 
GREG 
LESLIE 

The statue, Greg. I’ve got the entire  Parks Department watching you, and my  boyfriend’s a cop, so don’t even try it. 
GREG 
I don’t know what you’re talking about. 
LESLIE 
I think you do. It ends today,  
Pikitis. It ends. To. Day. 
She walks off.  
GREG 
Thanks for dropping by, Leslie. You  look great. 

(happy) 
Thank you. 
LESLIE 

(serious) 
Ends today. 
He smirks again and takes a bite of the peach. 
 .  
LESLIE TALKING HEAD 
LESLIE 
Ugh, this kid. We have a history,  
Greg and I. He absolutely terrorizes  
the parks system. 
B-roll Greg duct tapes a kid to a playground merry-go-round  and spins him around. Leslie chases him around the ride as  he keeps spinning it. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
Every Halloween, someone defaces the  
statue of Mayor Percy in Ramsett Park.  
B-roll A STATUE of a Founding Father type in a park. 
LESLIE (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
I know it’s Greg Pikitis, but I can  
never prove it. He’s like an  
invisible, adolescent, James Bond  
supervillain criminal mastermind. 
(beat) 
Or maybe somebody else is doing it,  
but I really think it’s him. 
INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER - D1 
ANN walks in and sees April, Jerry, DONNA, and RON. She  looks around a little and sees that Tom isn’t there. 
ANN 
Hey, Parks Department. Just reminding  
you all -- seven o’clock, in costume,  
my place. Everybody in? 
General assent. 
ANN TALKING HEAD 
ANN 
I called in a favor and got out of my  
shift -- being an ER nurse on  
Halloween is the worst.  
(to camera) 
People I don’t care how accurate you  
want to make your “Legolas” costume --  
don’t use a real sword. 
 .  
INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - D1 
ANN 
One more thing -- the people in this  
room, now, are the people I invited,  
so... just, don’t tell anyone else. 
APRIL 
(looking around) 
Who isn’t h-- 
Tom walks in. 
TOM 
Hey! What’s going on, cupcake? 
ANN 
(camera aware) 
Nothing. How are you? 
TOM 
Doing good. Excited about the party  
tonight. 
ANN 
(glancing to camera) 
Oh... you’re coming? Great. I was  
just about to tell you about that.  
TOM 
Jerry already told me. Can’t wait to  
see how small your costume is. What  
time does it start? 
Ann glares at Jerry, who tries to hide his face. 

Seven. 
Perfect.  
ANN TOM ANN 

Yes. Perfect. 
EXT. COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER - D1 
Leslie sits at the table working on something as three  MAINTENANCE GUYS put up Halloween decorations in the  courtyard. Ann sits with her. 
ANN 
I’ll be so sad if you’re not there. 
 .  
LESLIE 
I’ll come as soon as I can. But I  
have a full night of crime prevention  
ahead of me. Check it out. 
She holds up what she’s been working on -- a MAP of the city  with lots of ARROWS and MARKINGS and PATHS marked out. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
Every possible way Greg Pikitis can  
get from his house to the statue.  
ANN 
That looks like something you’d find  
on the wall of a serial killer. 
Leslie mulls that over. 
LESLIE 
In a way, that’s a compliment. Shows  
dedication. 
ANN 
Is it really that big a deal? So this  
kid TP’s some statue.  
LESLIE 
And all the trees, and all the benches.  
It takes us like ten days to clean his  
mess up. But more importantly Pikitis  
sucks, and I want to destroy him.  
ANN 
Well, if you destroy him early, please  
come by. 

I will. 
LESLIE 

Ann heads off. Leslie yells at a MAINTENANCE WORKER. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
Hey! How is anyone going to be able  
to walk through the door? 
Camera shows a MASSIVE GOB OF FAKE COBWEBS covering the  entire entryway to the courtyard. 

Oh. 
MAINTENANCE WORKER 

Jerry, not looking, WALKS INTO THE COBWEB and SCREAMS.  Leslie RUSHES OVER and helps him. 
 .  
EXT. PARK - EARLY EVENING - NIGHT 1 
Leslie stands at the statue of MAYOR PERCY with DAVE and  ANDY. Andy has his GUITAR CASE. 
LESLIE 
William Percy. One of Pawnee’s  
greatest mayors. And a true hero --  
during the Pawnee Bread Factory fire  
of 1, he rushed back into the  
burning building and saved the beloved  
secret recipe for Pawnee Pumpernickel! 
DAVE 
Didn’t like thirty people die in that  
fire? 
LESLIE 
(shrugs) 
He wasn’t Superman. 
ANDY 
He looks like a walrus, kind of. 
LESLIE 
Okay. Andy. Tonight, I am officially  
putting you on the Parks Department  
payroll. Eight dollars an hour. 

Whoo! 
ANDY 

She hands him a picture of Greg Pikitis. 
LESLIE 
Commit this to memory, then burn it.  Don’t burn it -- that’s insane. Keep  it. You see this kid, you stop him.  Knock his head off if you have to.  
DAVE 
Don’t do that. 
LESLIE 
Don’t do that. But you have my  
permission to use excessive force. 
DAVE 
Don’t use excessive force. 
 .  
LESLIE 
Don’t go overboard. But stop him. 
(quietly) 
By any means necessary. 

No. 
DAVE 
LESLIE 

No. Just stop him.  
Leslie gives him a look “Use excessive force.” He nods. ANDY TALKING HEAD 
At the statue.  
ANDY 
A week ago, I had nothing. Now I got  
a part-time job, and tonight I’m gonna  
make thirty-two bucks. I owe Leslie  
everything I have. 
(beat) 
Which, after tonight, will be thirty nine bucks. 
INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1 
Ann, dressed as RAGGEDY ANN, rushes around putting the  finishing touches on her place. It’s very well decorated.  “MONSTER MASH” is playing from her stereo.  
The DOORBELL RINGS. It’s RON, dressed as a PIRATE. 
RON 
Hello, Ann. Am I early? 
ANN 
Right on time. Come on in.  
RON 
I like your costume.  
ANN 
Raggedy Ann. It was my favorite book  
when I was a kid. I’m named after her. 
Beat. 
RON 
I’m a pirate. 
Beat. 
 10.  
ANN 
So, there’s food over there-- 
RON 
(a little too loud and eager) 
Is there bacon wrapped shrimp? By any  
chance? 
ANN 
No. Oh -- you love that, don’t you?  
I’m sorry. There’s candy... 
Ron looks crushed. DR. HARRIS enters, dressed like a doctor. 
ANN (CONT’D) 
Hey, Dr. Harris! 

Ann.  
DR. HARRIS ANN 

Come on in. This is Ron Swanson, from  the Parks Department -- I know him  
from that thing I’m doing. This is  Dr. Harris, from my hospital. 
They shake. 
RON 
You’re a doctor. 

Yup.  
DR. HARRIS  RON 

I meant, your costume. 
DR. HARRIS  
I got it. Pirate? 
Ron nods. Beat. Awkwardness. 
ANN 
I’m going to check on the... 
She’s got nothing. Walks off. 
ANN TALKING HEAD 
From her kitchen, with the two guys in the b.g. 
ANN 
Worlds colliding. Always awkward. 
 11.  
INT. LESLIE’S CAR - LATER - N1 
Leslie and Dave are watching through the windshield as GREG  and some FRIENDS hang out in a parking lot, skateboarding. 
LESLIE 
(into a recorder) 
 PM. Suspect still with friends  
in -Eleven parking lot. Looks  
obnoxious and irritating, even at a  
great distance. 
DAVE 
How long are we gonna follow this kid? 
LESLIE 
All night, if we have to. 
DAVE 
I was kind of hoping we could go to Ann’s  
party. That’s why I traded shifts. 
LESLIE 
This is kind of like a party. Here --  
I’ll put on some music. 
She hits a button on the stereo. SPOOKY GHOST SOUNDS start  playing -- chains rattling, etc. 
DAVE 
This is the CD you have in? 
LESLIE 
It’s Halloween! What do you want,  
Christmas music? 
(into recorder) 
Suspect is laughing with friends in a  
snide, turdish manner. 

“Turdish?” 
DAVE 
LESLIE 

Yes. Like a turd -- like a little  turd. 
She puts down her binoculars. 
DAVE TALKING HEAD 
Outside the car. 
 1.  
DAVE 
I called in a ton of favors and got  
out of my shift so I wouldn’t have to  
spend the night chasing after little  
punk kids who are out to cause  
trouble. Then Leslie called and said,  
“Hey, can you help me with something?” 
INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1 
There are a few more PEOPLE in the house, but the party is  pretty quiet. LAME HALLOWEEN SONGS are still playing. 
APRIL, DEREK, and BEN enter. She’s a HAPPY CLOWN with a big  smiley face. Ben is also a PIRATE, but it’s WAY MORE  ELABORATE than Ron’s costume. Derek is wearing a button-down  shirt and tan pants. 

Hey, guys! 
ANN 
APRIL 

Hey. You remember my boyfriend Derek,  and his boyfriend Ben? 

Yeah, hi.  
ANN 

(to Derek) 
It’s totally fine that you didn’t wear  
a costume. 
DEREK 
I did. I’m a straight person. 
MARK enters holding a bag with his costume in it. He’s  wearing exactly the same outfit as Derek. 

Hey, honey. See? 
MARK DEREK MARK 

Gotta change. Be right back. 
He disappears. 
ANN 
Come on in. Sorry it’s kind of lame  right now. 
 1.  
APRIL 
That’s cool. I’m kind of into lame  
stuff in an ironic way right now. I’m  
going to a botanical garden tomorrow. 
APRIL TALKING HEAD 
APRIL 
This Halloween party is dressed up as  
a funeral. 
INT. ANN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - N1 
Ann and Mark. He’s now dressed as an Indiana Pacer. 
ANN 
I spent the entire day decorating this  
whole house, and everyone just hangs  
out in the kitchen. Why do people  
always just hang out in the kitchen?! 
In the b.g. we see that literally everyone is in the kitchen. 
MARK 
It’s going fine. 
ANN 
It’s a little quiet. And all the  
nurses and doctors are just dressed as  
nurses and doctors. That’s so lame. 
Camera sees, in the kitchen, a bunch of NURSES and DOCTORS in  their usual work gear. 
ANN (CONT'D) 
Oh my God -- this party is flailing. 
Ron approaches with a fistful of Almond Joys. 
RON 
Ann, do you have any Mounds? All I  
see are Almond Joys, and I hate those. 
Ann rubs her head. 
INT. LESLIE’S CAR - LATER - N1 
They are still watching Greg and his friends. 
LESLIE 
Can’t we just go rough him up a little? 
 1.  
DAVE 
He’s not doing anything. 
LESLIE 
C’mon. We can do whatever we want.  
We’re cops. 
DAVE 
“We” are not cops.  
LESLIE 
Deputize me! 
DAVE 
Look -- your scare tactics clearly  
worked. You’ve got Andy guarding the  
statue. Let’s go to the party. 
Leslie thinks. She puts the car in drive... 
LESLIE 
Fine. I have to stop by City Hall --  
my costume is in my office. Just...  
fire a warning shot over his head as  
we drive by. 
INT. PIONEER HALLWAY - LATER - N1 
Dave and Leslie near the door. Leslie searches in her purse. 
LESLIE 
Ugh -- where are my keys? 
DAVE 
Looks like it’s open. 

Really? 
LESLIE 

Leslie, confused, walks through the open door, and... INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - N1 ...She FREEZES. 
REVEAL the entire department has been VANDALIZED. Toilet  paper everywhere. Silly string. SPRAY PAINT on the walls  that reads “HAPPY HALLOWEEN, SUCKAZ.”  

Pikitis! 
LESLIE 
END OF ACT ONE 

 1.  
ACT TWO 
INT. LESLIE AND TOM’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - N1 
Leslie RUSHES to her office. It’s been hit too -- silly  string, MOUSTACHES drawn on all the pictures of famous women.  Spray-painted on the wall is “Crappy Halloweiners!” 
DAVE 
(rushing in behind her) 
Who did this? 
LESLIE 
It’s that kid! I told you!  
Leslie looks around... sees something on her desk... 
DAVE 
Leslie, we tailed him for the last two  
hours. There must be another kid who  
hates you. 
LESLIE 
(staring at her desk) 
It was Pikitis. 
She holds up a PEACH PIT that was lying on the desk. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
(super dramatic) 
Believe me now?  
DAVE 
...That means nothing to me. 
LESLIE 
He was eating a peach when I went to  
talk to him! This is his ace of  
spades! It’s still warm. Now go 
arrest him! 
(holds up pit) 
And send this to the lab! 
DAVE 
We don’t have a lab.  
INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1 
Mark and Ann are talking awkwardly to a nurse, PAULA. Paula  is very severe. 
PAULA 
So you’re the Mark that Ann is dating. 
 1.  
MARK 
I suppose I am. 
PAULA 
We’re very protective of Ann. We look  
out for her. You mess with one of us,  
you mess with all of us.  
MARK 
I don’t want to mess with anyone, for  
any reason. 
PAULA 
Nurses look out for each other.  
MARK 
Well... you guys kind of dropped the  
ball with Andy, huh? 
Paula instantly softens. 
PAULA 
Awwww... Andy! I loved Andy. Such a  
sweetheart. 
(to Ann) 
Where’s Andy? Is he coming tonight?  
You should get back with Andy. 
Mark sips a beer, awkwardly. Ann cringes a little.  
ANN 
Who needs a drink? 
INT. ANN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - N1 
She heads to the bar and looks around people look bored.  April walks up. 
ANN 
Hey, April. You having a good time? 
APRIL 
Derek broke up with me. He said he  
wants to focus more on his boyfriend.  
But that’s just what you say when you  
want to blow off your girlfriend. 
April swigs directly from a bottle of gin. 
ANN 
You’re... underage. 
 1.  

You’re not. 
APRIL 

 Dr. Harris approaches. 
DR. HARRIS 
Yeah, I’m gonna leave. 

Oh. Okay. 
ANN 
DR. HARRIS 

This isn’t that fun. 
ANN 
Didn’t need to tell me that. 
He holds up a full bottle of wine. 
DR. HARRIS 
I’m gonna take this home. Nobody was  
drinking it, so I’m gonna take it. 
He takes a book off her shelf. 
DR. HARRIS (CONT’D) 
I’m gonna take this too. I’ve been  
meaning to read this. 
Ann sighs. 
INT. CITY HALL - SECURITY DESK - LATER - N1 
Leslie and Dave are watching SECURITY TAPE FOOTAGE with BILL,  the night guard. It’s just shots of the hallway. 
LESLIE 
Okay, freeze it! Right there! 
Bill hits pause. There is a MAN in the hallway. 

Enhance! 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 

(off his look) 
Enhance! Enhance image!  
BILL 
It’s just a VCR-- 
LESLIE 
Enhance! Rotate! 
Another COP comes in with GREG in tow. Greg looks around. 
 1.  
GREG 
Whoa. What happened here? 
LESLIE 
Greg Pikitis. Let’s chat. 
(to cop) 
Bring him to Interrogation Room 1. 
(no response) 
The conference room, with the deer  
mural. 
The cop leads Greg off. 
DAVE 
Listen -- this isn’t strictly “legal.”  
I can give you about an hour to talk  
to him, and then I have to let him go. 
LESLIE 
You talk to him first. A real cop  
should put the fear of God into him. 
(hands him a pair of pliers) 
Here. Use these. 

What? 
DAVE 
LESLIE 

Just as props. Or on his fingernails. 
DAVE 
Why don’t I just talk to him? 
LESLIE 
(shrugs) 
Okay. Do it the hard way. 
DAVE TALKING HEAD 
DAVE 
Leslie is very smart, she’s an  
extremely high-energy individual, and  
her hair has an appealing color. But  
I’m glad she isn’t a cop. I would  
feel very unsafe, living in any city  
that she is a cop of. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - N1 
Dave sits down across from Greg, who looks pretty calm.  Leslie stands outside and watches through the window. 
 1.  
GREG 
Why am I here? What is this place? 
DAVE 
This is the Parks Department. Someone  
vandalized it tonight and we have  
reason to believe it was you. 
GREG 
Well, it wasn’t. I’ve never been here  
before.  
DAVE 
Son, I’m a police officer. You  
shouldn’t lie to me. 
GREG 
I’m not. And why would I do this? 
DAVE 
Because you’ve had run-ins with Ms.  
Knope in the past.  
Dave’s PHONE RINGS. 
DAVE (CONT’D) 
Hold on a minute. 
(into phone) 
Yeah. 
LESLIE (V.O.) 
(on phone) 
Ask him about the peach pit!  
Greg looks over at Leslie, watching through the window and  talking on her phone, while holding the peach pit. 
GREG 
This isn’t one-way glass, you know. I  
can see you. You’re right there. 
Leslie suddenly gets self-conscious, and walks to her office. INT. LESLIE AND TOM’S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER - N1 Leslie is looking at her computer when Andy walks in. 
ANDY 
Hey. I came as soon as I could. Holy  
cow! That kid did this? 
 0.  
LESLIE 
Yes. And I have about forty-five  
minutes to prove it. 
ANDY 
Well, the statue is fine. So I still  
get paid, right? Silver lining. 
Leslie frowns. 
LESLIE 
(to her computer) 
Come on! This is total b.s.! 
ANDY 
What are you reading? 
LESLIE 
The Geneva Convention. 
LESLIE TALKING HEAD 
LESLIE 
Torture is a very dicey subject. Jack  
Bauer can torture people because he’s  
always right. If he were wrong, he’d  
just be a crazy guy who hooks wires up  
to people’s nipples. And the show  
would be called “Crazy Wire Nipple  
Torture Man.” Or maybe “Dexter.” But  
I know I’m right. 
(beat) 
I think I’m right. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER - N1 
Greg and Dave. 
GREG 
So. You and Knope, huh? 

Excuse me? 
DAVE GREG 

She said her boyfriend was a cop. Are  you her boyfriend? 
DAVE 
That’s not... relevant. 
GREG 
Just want to say nice pull. 
 1.  
DAVE 
Thank you, but that’s not appropriate.  
But thank you. 
GREG 
I like Knope. I screw with her  
because she gets all riled up, and her  
face scrunches up like this -- 
He demonstrates. Dave chuckles. 
GREG (CONT'D) 
But I like her. She’s all right. 
DAVE 
So you swear you didn’t do this? 
GREG 
I swear. I’ve been hanging out with  
my friends all night. And silly  
string isn’t really my style. 
Dave thinks. 
INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1 
Ann is replenishing a bowl of CHIPS.  
RON 
Are these the same kind of chips? 

(testy) 
ANN 

Would you like them better if they had  bacon wrapped around them? 

Yes. 
RON 
ANN 
(sees something) 

Oh God. 
WHIP OVER to reveal Tom and WENDY. He’s dressed like T-PAIN,  with a crazy top hat and gold teeth. She’s a COWGIRL. 
TOM 
Annie! What’s up, gorgeous! Get your  
Raggedy ass over here. 
ANN 
(forced smile) 
Hey, Tom. Mad Hatter?

T-Pain!  
TOM 

(singing) 
She poppin’ she rollin’ she rollin’ / 
She climbin’ that pole and / 
I'm in love with a stripper! 
(beat) 
This is my wife, Wendy.  
WENDY 
Hi. Thanks for inviting us. 
TOM 
She’s a surgeon at County General, and  
she’s super hot. Sorry we’re late.  
As soon as she put on that cowgirl  
outfit I lost control of myself, and  
we got a little de-layed. Get it? 
Wendy playfully smacks him. 
ANN 
Thanks for being a doctor and not  
coming dressed like a doctor. 
WENDY 
...Who’d be boring enough to do that? 
Ann motions. Wendy looks over to see several DOCTORS and  NURSES right near her. 

Oh.

The only thing this disastrous party  was missing Tom “Even the Presence of  My Wife Doesn’t Stop Me From Being  Sleazy With Women” Haverford. 
INT. ANN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - N1 
TOM 
Ann, can I offer some constructive  criticism? Your costume could be a  little more revealing. But you’re  
still bangin’. 
(looking around) 
Your party, however, is not. 
 .  
ANN 
Yeah. It’s a little quiet. 
TOM 
No worries. The Haverfords are on the  
case. Sweetheart, get the iPod from  
the car, please.  
Tom and Wendy high-five and Wendy heads off. 
TOM (CONT’D) 
Check this out. AutoTune. 
He holds up his iPhone and we hear his AutoTuned voice. 
TOM (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
(singing into iPhone) 
I’m in love with a stripper! 
Ann smiles weakly. 
TOM (CONT’D) 
I love that. Hey -- do you have any  
Skyy Vodka? I only drink Skyy. 
INT. LESLIE AND TOM’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - N1 
Dave, Andy, Leslie. 
DAVE 
I don’t know what to tell you. I  
really don’t think he did it. 
LESLIE 
Yes, he did. We need a confession.  
Andy and I will “take a walk.” You’ll  
be all alone with him. Get my drift? 
DAVE 
Leslie, you’re out of control. 
LESLIE 
Maybe you’re too in control?! 
Andy jumps in. 
ANDY 
Let me take a run at him, boss. I’ll  
get him to talk. In order to think  
like one of these guys, you have to  
think like them. 
 .  
LESLIE 
Good idea. He’s never seen you  
before. Imply that you’re someone  
very important and can make his life  
hell. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - N1 
Andy is seated across from Greg. 
ANDY 
(shaking hands) 
Greg? Bert Macklin, FBI. I can make  
your life hell. 
GREG 
(smirks) 
Just flew in from Washington, did you? 
ANDY 
The FBI Office in Indiana, dumbass.  
There’s one in Indiana. 

Where? 
GREG ANDY 

Bloomington. Look it up. 

Okay. 
GREG 

Greg takes out an iPhone. Andy snatches it away. 

Gimme that. 
ANDY 

(breaking) 
Ooh, is this the new one? 
GREG 
Yeah. It’s awesome. 
ANDY 
(serious; in character) 
Do yourself a favor. Get that app  where it looks like you’re drinking a  beer. It’s hilarious. Now tell me  why did you attack this office? 
GREG 
I’ll tell you just like I told  everyone else. I didn’t do this. 
 .  
Andy stares at him. Greg stares back, completely relaxed. 
ANDY 
You’re lying. I can tell, because of  
the training we went through. 
GREG 
I’m not lying. 
Andy stares at him. 
ANDY 
That time it didn’t seem like you were  
lying.  
INT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - N1 
At the stereo, Tom leans down and removes Ann’s iPod from the  dock. “Monster Mash” stops. He puts his own iPod on. 
ANN 
What are you doing? 
TOM 
Annie. Do you want this party to be  
lame or fun? 

Fun. 
ANN TOM 

Then relax. And turn off all the  
lights in here except the ones with  
colored bulbs. 
Ann thinks. Then she flicks off some lights as Tom hits play  and “RUN THIS TOWN” by Jay-Z and Rhianna starts playing. Tom  yells out to the room. 
TOM (CONT’D) 
Playtime’s over, kids. Let’s get  
wiiiiiiiild!! 
Tom grabs Wendy and they start to dance in the living room.  Ann glances around and sees that people are starting to  groove a little. She glances to camera -- “This might work?”

Hopefully, Andy broke him down, and I  
can finish him off.

Leslie walks in. Greg is making fun of Andy. 
GREG 
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever  
heard! 

Shut up! 
ANDY 
LESLIE 

What’s going on? 
ANDY 
He’s being a little jerk. 
GREG 
Are you crying?! 
ANDY 
No. I’m allergic to jerks.  
LESLIE 
Andy, out. I’ll take it from here. 
ANDY 
(childish mumbling) 
Fine, I don’t even care... about  
the... whatever... stupid... 
Andy leaves. Leslie stares at Greg. 
LESLIE 
The gloves are coming off. 
LESLIE TALKING HEAD 
LESLIE 
One of America’s tactics in Gitmo was  
to play rock music really loudly.  
Well, let’s see you how you hold up to  
Sarah McLachlan, you son of a bitch. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - N1 
“ADIA” by Sarah McLachlan is playing loudly in the b.g. 
 .  
GREG 
What is this? I kinda like it. 

Damnit. 
LESLIE 

(to herself) 
Why do you have to be so good, Sarah? 
Leslie stops the music. SMACKS the peach pit down. 
GREG 
What’s that? 
LESLIE 
You know what it is. You were eating  
a peach when I saw you today at the  
school. Then my office gets  
vandalized, and I find this on my  
desk? You think that’s a coincidence? 
GREG 
Wow, you nailed me. There’s no way two  different people could have both eaten  fruit on the same day, in the same part  of Indiana. Never mind that I was  
actually eating a plum when you saw me. Leslie hesitates. She looks unsure. Then 

(angry) 
LESLIE 

I know you did this. I don’t care  what you say. I don’t care that you  spent the whole night in that parking  lot. You did this, somehow, and I’m-- 
GREG 
How did you know that? 

...Hmm? 
LESLIE GREG 

That I spent the whole night in that  parking lot? Did you follow me? 
LESLIE 
I have every right to... follow people. 
GREG 
If you followed me all night then you  know it wasn’t me! Oh my God! Knope,  what is your problem? 
 .  
LESLIE 
Listen. I have been very civil. But  
I will waterboard you. 
Greg gets out his phone and dials. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
Fine. You get one phone call. That’s  
fair. 
GREG 
(into phone) 
Mom? This crazy lady from the Parks  
Department is holding me hostage. 
Leslie looks worried.

Please, Dave. Arrest him.  
DAVE

LESLIE 
Then... handcuff him to something! Why  
do I have to come up with all the ideas?! 
Dave looks over -- camera WHIPS to see DEBORAH, Greg’s mom,  striding angrily into the room. 
DEBORAH 
Greggy? Greg! 
GREG (O.S.)

I’m in here, Mom. 
INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - N1 
Leslie, Dave, and Andy walk out of Leslie’s office and  intercept Deborah. Greg comes out of the conference room. 
LESLIE 
Hello, Mrs. Pikitis. I’m Leslie  
Knope, and this is Officer Sanderson. 
ANDY 
Bert Macklin, FBI. 
 .  
DEBORAH 
What the hell are you doing?! You  
can’t just hold a sixteen-year-old kid  
against his will. 
DAVE 
We just wanted to question him about  
this vandalism. 
DEBORAH 
Do you have any evidence? 
LESLIE 
Yes. This peach pit. Which has his  
DNA all over it, I’m guessing. 
DEBORAH 
(to Dave) 
I’m calling your shift commander. 
(to Leslie) 
Monday morning, I’m calling your boss.  
And if any of you ever come near my  
son again, I swear to God I will sue  
you, and everyone in this building. 
They leave. Leslie looks sad. She stares after Greg. 
LESLIE 
Let them leave. Let them think  
they’ve lost us. Then we-- 
Dave is walking away. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
Where are you going? 
DAVE 
I have to explain to my boss why I  
illegally detained a teenager. I  
never should have gone along with  
this. This was... bad police work. 
Dave walks off. Leslie looks defeated.

Yeah, this was bad FBI work, too. END OF ACT TWO

The party is HOPPING. People are DANCING and having a good  time. Tom and Wendy are dancing in the middle of the living  room as people cheer them on. 
ANN 
Coming through! Coming through! 
Ann walks around replenishing drinks. She sees Mark chatting  with Paula again. It seems to be going well. She smiles and  sees April, Derek, and Ben talking. 
ANN (CONT’D) 
How you guys doing? 
BEN 
We totally worked it out.  
APRIL 
Derek is going to be gay-monogamous  
with Ben, but we’re going to keep  
making out when we’re drunk, and also  
we agreed that we can see other  
people, but if I make out with any  
other gay guys I have to tell him. 
DEREK 
We’re not going to put a label on it. 
ANN 
Good thinking. 
Ron comes up and looks at Ben’s pirate costume. 
RON 
Son. That is a helluva costume. 

Thanks. 
BEN 

Ron shakes his head in admiration. 

God damn. 
RON

LESLIE 
Why would anyone do this? 
ANDY 
Kids are kids. Everybody does stupid  
stuff like this in high school. 

I didn’t. 
LESLIE ANDY 

Well, you were a nerd, probably,  right? 

Hey. 
LESLIE ANDY 

No -- I mean, that’s a good thing.  
You were a nerd, and I was cool, but  
now look at us. If you didn’t pay me  
thirty-two dollars to guard a walrus  
all night, I’d literally have zero  
dollars. Plus, you’re cool now. 
She smiles. 
LESLIE 
Well. You can head on home. I’ll  
finish cleaning this place up. 
ANDY 
No way. I go home when you go home. 
She looks at him. 
ANDY (CONT'D) 
You got me a job, you’re helping me  
turn my life around. You’re my  
guardian angel, Leslie. I’m not  
leaving your side. 
She smiles and they go back to cleaning.

Hey. Ron. 
WENDY

RON 
Hello, Wendy. You and Tom really  
turned the party around. 
WENDY 
We have a good time together. 
(beat) 
Listen -- I know that you know about  
our marriage. 
Ron feigns confusion. 
WENDY (CONT’D) 
The whole green card thing. Tom told  
me you know, and that you’re not going  
to tell anyone. I just wanted to say  
thanks for that. 
RON 
No worries. I’d hate for you to have  
to go back to Canada. All that  
socialized medicine. 
Ron shudders at the thought. Tom grooves over. 
TOM 
Sweetheart! Where have you been? 
WENDY 
Hey. I was just... thanking Ron. For  
not telling anyone... 
TOM 
Oh. Yeah. It’s mighty white of you,  
Boss. 
WENDY 
You won’t have to keep it secret much  
longer. In a few months we can split  
up without raising any eyebrows. And  
we’ll invite you to the divorce party! 
RON 
Looking forward to it. 
Tom frowns a little, then recovers. 
TOM 
A’ight, let’s go! These dance moves  
aren’t going to awesome themselves!

Bye!

Tom and Wendy go back and start dancing up a storm. Ron  looks at them for a beat.

out.

I guess this means there’s some other  
kid out there who’s tormenting me. 

Maybe. 
ANDY 
LESLIE 

Greg does seem innocent. 

Yeah. 
ANDY 
LESLIE 

I believe you’re innocent until proven  guilty, in this country. That’s the  cornerstone of democracy.  

Sure. 
ANDY 
LESLIE 

On the other hand. Greg Pikitis is a  
little punk. And I kind of want to TP  
his house. 
ANDY 
Let’s do it. 
They jump up, grab the trash bags full of toilet paper, and  rush out.

This is so fun! What do I do? 
ANDY 
Just take this toilet paper and throw  
it into the tree. 
They both start doing it. 
LESLIE 
This is for Mayor Percy! And the  
Parks Department office! And that  
time I caught you pooping on the  
handball court!

My pleasure.

And you know what else? Your wife is  
super cool. 
TOM 
Oh yeah -- she’s great, right?

I really liked talking to her. I  
don’t know how you landed that chick,  
but nice work. She’s awesome. You’re  
really lucky.  
Tom looks a tiny bit sad as Wendy comes up. 
ANN (CONT’D) 
Hey. We were just talking about you.  
So nice to see you. 
WENDY 
You, too! Thanks for everything. 
They hug. Tom and Wendy leave. Mark is the last one there. EXT. GREG’S HOUSE - LATER - N1

Leslie? What are you doing? 

Oh boy. 
LESLIE 

The FRONT PORCH LIGHT goes on and a woman, EVELYN, comes out. 
EVELYN 
That’s them, officer! Right there! 
Leslie panics. 
LESLIE 
Oh my God. I am so sorry, ma’am. I  
think we’re at the wrong house. 
EVELYN 
Why are you doing this?! 
LESLIE 
...It’s hard to explain. I’m getting  
revenge on this kid, Greg Pikitis, and  
I thought this was his house, but I  
guess I got the address wrong-- 
EVELYN 
I’m Greg’s mom. 
 .  
Beat. 

You are? 
LESLIE EVELYN 

Yes. I’m Evelyn Pikitis. 
(beat) 
Oh God. Did he hire a fake mom again,  
to get him out of trouble? That  
little S.O.B.! 
She rushes back in the house. Leslie, Dave, and Andy are  stunned. 
LESLIE 
I. Knew it! 

Oh my God. 
DAVE ANDY 

Dude. That kid is amazing. 
Evelyn comes rushing back out.

FLASHBACK TO 
EXT. COURTYARD - EARLIER - D1 
We are watching the scene from earlier Leslie in the  courtyard. She yells at the MAINTENANCE WORKER. 
LESLIE 
Hey! How is anyone going to be able  
to walk through the door? 

Oh. 
MAINTENANCE WORKER 

Jerry walks through and gets caught in the cobweb.  
LESLIE (V.O.) 
The cleaning crew always locks all the  
doors. How’d he get in? 
A DIFFERENT CAMERA WHIPS OVER to see one of the maintenance  workers sneak up to Leslie’s PURSE. It’s GREG, in a  JANITOR’S OUTFIT and a FAKE MOUSTACHE. He STEALS THE KEYS  from her purse and then CRAWLS INTO one of the GARBAGE CANS. 
EXT. COURTYARD - LATER - D1 
SPY SHOT It’s 00. The Parks Department is leaving for the  day. Greg SNEAKS OUT OF THE TRASH CAN, grabs a BACKPACK, and  uses the keys to UNLOCK the DOOR to the department and SNEAKS  INSIDE.

left his house to the moment we picked  
him up.

Does he have a look-a-like, or  
something? 
EXT. COURTYARD - LATER - D1 
Greg tosses the outfit, fake moustache, and backpack full of  stuff into the trash can and walks out.

A super energetic Kaboom Project Manager, KEEF SLERTNER,  addresses a crowd of people on a makeshift stand. 
KEEF 
Are you ready to build a playground?! 
The crowd cheers. REVEAL LESLIE, ANN, TOM, RON, and JERRY  standing in the crowd, wearing red “KaBOOM!” t-shirts and  cheering. Keef does a sprinkler-type dance on stage.  
KEEF (CONT’D) 
I can’t hear you! 
People cheer louder. Keef spins around on the ground doing a  breakdancing move. He pops back up.  
KEEF (CONT’D) 
Awesome. It’s playground time!!! 
Leslie looks to camera, a little bemused by the energy.  LESLIE TALKING HEAD  
LESLIE 
We’re in Eagleton. It’s two towns over.  
We’re all volunteering for Kaboom, a  
service group that “says” they build  
playgrounds in a day. Never trust  
anything that comes too quickly. That’s  
why I don’t eat minute rice. Only a  
minute for all that rice? Something’s  
up. 
 EXT. EAGLETON LOT - LATER - D1  Leslie, Ann, and Keef stand in front of the playground area. 
LESLIE 
So that whole “Build a playground in a  
day” thing, that’s just a slogan, right?  
It’s gotta take a lot longer. 
KEEF 
Nope! One day, twenty-four hours, you  
only get one shot. 
(segueing into “Lose Yourself”  
by Eminem) 
Do not miss your chance to blow this  
opportunity to... build a playground!

   KEEF (CONT'D)
Sorry, Eminem, had to take some liberties  
with the lyrics! 
LESLIE 
Wow. Keef. That is incredible. I work  
in parks, it can be so hard to get things  
done-- 
KEEF 
Not if you have the Kaboom spirit. When  
you see a problem, you can either let it  
be a problem or -- kaboom -- you blow it  
up and turn it into something great. You  
literally “kaboom” the problem. 
LESLIE 
So you don’t let a problem be a  
problem... 
KEEF 
Leslie, don’t be too literal. That’s  
“kersplat.”  
(to Ann) 
That’s the opposite of kaboom. See,  
Kaboom is about being impatient. Why  
should kids have to wait for a fun place  
to kaboom with their friends? 
LESLIE 
What about public forums and neighborhood  
groups? 
KEEF 
Kaboom! Kaboom! It’s that easy.  
A volunteer hands Keef a bunch of material. He dumps it in  front of them. 
KEEF (CONT’D) 
You can do anything! You are masters of  
the Kaboom-i-verse! Now fill this  
sandbox with kaboom! Sand! May the  
kaboom be with you!  
He sprints off. Leslie tosses Ann a shovel. 
LESLIE 
Yeah! Come on, it’s shovel time! We  
can’t let those jackasses beat us!

And you da Ann, Ann. Are you going to  
join us tomorrow in Muncie? 
LESLIE 
We can’t. Back to the real world.

As long as you’re kabooming somewhere.  
Remember, take a man kabooming, he  
kabooms for a day. But teach a man to  
kaboom... kaboom, kaboom, kaboom. 
Keef turns to the other Kaboomers. 
KEEF (CONT’D) 
Okay, I love you! Great job! I’ll see  
you all tomorrow in Muncie!

The car pulls up in front of Ann’s house. 
ANN 
Ugh, there it is... the pit. That’s  
something I wish we could kaboom. 
They contemplate it for a beat. 
LESLIE 
Yeah. Well, we are -- it’s a slow-boom.  
A slower, more deliberate kaboom.

Yeah, no. Totally. See you tomorrow.

We need to cut through the red tape and  
get the pit filled in. 
LESLIE 
Good, Tom. Now, the rest of you need to  
participate, too. C’mon! These  
suggestions aren’t going to suggest  
themselves.  
Leslie sits back, waits for the ideas. Jerry raises his  hand. Leslie notices it and looks at him expectantly. He  slowly lowers his hand.

I want to kaboom the pit. I. Want.  
This. Done. This is going to happen.  
It doesn’t matter how. It matters when.  
And when is yes. 
Mark looks at her and she seems serious. 
MARK 
Can I see you outside for a second? 
Leslie nods. As she and Mark exit... 
LESLIE 
Mark’s going to help me, Jerry. Thanks  
for nothing. 
Jerry looks around, beaten. 
1 EXT. COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER - D 1 SPY SHOT Mark and Leslie stand over a railing.

So you really want to get this pit filled  
in? 

Yes.  
LESLIE

MARK 
You’ll do whatever it takes? 
LESLIE 
Mark, I’m so sick of moving like a slug.  
I want to move like a cheetah. Or a slug  
driving a remote control car. I don’t  
know, something more plausible than that,  
but fast. 
MARK 
I wanna hear more about SuperSlug. 
LESLIE 
He would have a lot of adventures... but  
you know what I’m talking about.  
MARK 
Yeah. You want to kazoo this? 

Kaboom.  
LESLIE MARK 

Right. Okay, so you want to kaboom it. 

Yes. 
LESLIE MARK 

Would you break the rules? 
Super long beat. 
LESLIE 
(small) 
I won’t murder. I will not. 
Mark gives her a look. 
MARK 
Good to know. Look, it’s actually very  
simple. If you want to fill in the pit,  
just fill it in.  
Leslie looks confused. 
MARK (CONT’D) 
Don’t ask for permission, ask for  
forgiveness.  
LESLIE 
(writes it down) 
I like that.

Now, who gives me the go-ahead to not ask  
for permission but ask for forgiveness?  
Is it Ron?  
MARK 
It’s nobody. You have to be bold. 

Okay... 
LESLIE 

Mark sees that Leslie doesn’t totally follow. 
MARK 
You remember that stop sign I got put up  on Cavanaugh? No one gave me permission  to do that.  
Leslie stares at him, shocked. 
MARK (CONT’D) 
It needed to get done, and it was going  to take forever, so I skipped some steps. 

(rapt) 
How many? 
LESLIE MARK 

I don’t know... eight? 

Shut up. 
LESLIE MARK 

You want to fill in the pit? Rent a  
bulldozer and fill in the freakin’ pit.  
Leslie’s mind is blown. 
1 LESLIE TALKING HEAD 1 
LESLIE 
Mark gave me some brilliant advice. So  
I’m gonna try it. Bein’ bold...

Ahhhh!

LESLIE 
(whispering, to camera) 
It was crazy. I didn’t get a single  
permit. Nobody stamped anything. I just  
rented a backhoe, and it came with a guy  
that runs it. I’ve never rented a guy  
before. I wish I’d known about it during  
prom.  
ANN 
There was a girl at my prom who was known  
as “the back ho.” Mary Dunbar. She’d  
let anyone massage her back.  
LESLIE 
We’re really doing this! And without  
getting permission! We’re giving  
ourselves permission. 
ANN 
I give you permission. 
LESLIE 
And I give you permission.  
Leslie pulls out a shopping bag. 
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
I had hard hats made. 
She holds up two hard hats. One says “KICK” and the other  says “ASS”.  
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
See? Kick ass! 
Ann quickly grabs the one that says “kick.”  
LESLIE (CONT’D) 
This is so cool! Don’t you feel giddy?  
I’m really proud of us!  
They hug each other.  
BACKHOE DRIVER

We fill in this pit now not with dirt,  
but with the courage of a thousand lions  
and the solemn memory of all our friends  
who have fallen in this cursèd hole. 
(shouts) 
Dump it! 
The backhoe releases a bucket of dirt into the hole.  
ANDY (O.S.) 
Aagh! What the fuck?! 
THE CAMERA ZOOMS INTO the pit to catch a dirt-covered man  staggering out of a pile of garbage bags. He can’t see,  wiping his eyes. 

Andy?! 
ANN 

Yep, it’s ANDY. Off Leslie’s horrified face. 
ANDY 
It’s okay. I’m okay. 
Another bucket is dumped on his head. He collapses. END OF ACT ONE

CLOSE UP of a heart rate monitor. There is a flatline on the  screen. Ann and another nurse run into the room, then pull  up and look across the room. Andy is there holding his EKG  lead in his fingers.  
ANDY 
That beep was so annoying. But the  
“eeeeeee” is even worse. 
ANN 
I’ll handle this.  
The other nurse leaves.  
ANN (CONT’D) 
The monitor is not a toy, Andy. 
ANDY 
Anything’s a toy if you play with it. 
ANN 
I’m going to chalk that up to your  
concussion.  
Ann checks his chart. 
ANN (CONT’D) 
Well, the good news is -- your CAT scan  
is clear. Andy, I’m really glad you’re  
okay. Leslie was so worried, too. We  
should have checked if you were... home. 
ANDY 
Aw, no, I told you, I moved out of the  
pit. I just had to go back because I  
forgot my headphones, then I lay down on  
this really comfortable tarp, and I saw  
an old cereal box I hadn’t read before.  
Anyway, I must have drifted off. Next  
thing I know... FWSSSSSSH! Dirt. 
ANN 
Well, again, I’m really sorry. I got you  
some extra pillows. 
Ann places some pillows around Andy. 
ANDY 
Mmmm, perfect. It’s like I’m lying in a

much I love soft things. Nice. 

...Okay.

I did. What’s my crime? I got bold?  
And a little negligent?

not gonna prance for anybody, Ron.

Are you high? 
LESLIE 
High on Kaboom, man! Don’t ask for

Okay, no -- what do you think is  
happening right now? 
ANDY 
A tragic accident reignited feelings you  
thought were long dead and now we’re back  
together. Right? No? 
Ann shakes her head. 
ANN 
No. Andy. You and I are not back  
together. You know I’m kind of with Mark  
now. 
ANDY 
Uch, that’s still happening?  
ANN 
Yeah, that’s “still happening.” 
ANDY 
I don’t get it. What does he have that I  
don’t?

literally everything you don’t have. A  
job, a car, steady income, an address...

ANDY 
Ann thinks Mark has it all. And I guess  
she’s right.

But she was wrong about one thing.  
Hazel. Her eyes are hazel. 
(he smiles, then, totally  
backing out) 
I’m like eighty percent sure her eyes are  
hazel. 
He looks glum. The realization sinks in that he’s a loser.  INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER - D  
Leslie walks down the hall carrying a cute stuffed pig with  its leg in a cast. A balloon around its neck reads “HOPE  YOU SQUEAL BETTER.” 
LESLIE 
I feel awful about Andy, but sometimes  
when you make an omelette, you break a  
few eggs. What’s the alternative? No  
omelettes at all? Who wants to live in  
that world? Birds, probably. Then all  
their babies would live.

   Just before she reaches Andy’s door, she hears... 
SCOTT (O.S.) 
Ms. Knope!! 
She turns to see a lawyerly-looking man, SCOTT BRADDOCK,  running down the hall. 
SCOTT (CONT’D) 
Wait! Ms. Knope? Scott Braddock, City  
Attorney. Ron told me you were coming  
here.  
LESLIE 
Hey, Scott! I didn’t know you were  
friends with Andy.  
SCOTT 
Never met him. All I know is he could  
sue us at the drop of a hat. He’s the  
most dangerous man in Pawnee right now.  
LESLIE 
Is that all you lawyers think about?  
Lawsuits... and laws... and legalese? 

Yes.  
SCOTT LESLIE 

Well, you can relax. I know how to  
handle myself. I’m just going to tell  
Andy that I’m so sorry, this was entirely  
my fault, and ask if there’s anything I  
can do to make it okay. 
Scott looks horrified. 
SCOTT 
No no no. You can’t say any of that. It  
admits liability. You can’t say “sorry,”  
or “I apologize,” or anything that  
implies guilt. 
LESLIE 
That’s insane. I have to apologize.  
Andy was the victim-- 
SCOTT 
Can’t say “victim.” 
LESLIE 
--of an extremely unfortunate situation-- 

 1.  
    
SCOTT 
Can’t say “unfortunate,” can’t say  
“situation.” 
LESLIE 
I can’t say the word “situation?”

Hm. You were in the pit--

We’re not conceding that point. 
LESLIE 
Okay. You were in a place. We’re both

LESLIE (CONT’D) 
But earlier we were somewhere else, where  
an event-- 
Scott clears his throat. 
LESLIE (CONT’D)

Scott shakes his head.

The government of-- 

Nooooo.

Andy looks confused. A man in a suit, WENDELL ADAMS (late  0s), enters.  
SCOTT (CONT’D) 
Okay, we’re out of here. 

Wait, why? 
LESLIE 

Wendell extends his hand to Leslie. 
WENDELL 
Wendell Adams. I’m Andrew’s attorney. 
Leslie drops his hand, slowly moves toward Scott. 
LESLIE 
Andy, no. We built a playground  
together. 
ANDY 
It’s my only option.

WENDELL 
Andy, stop. I’ve advised my client not  
to speak with you. He’s suing the City  
of Pawnee.  
SCOTT 
We admit no liability at all. 
WENDELL 
(laughs) 
Please, she all but admitted that there  
was a situation.  
SCOTT 
I disagree. No situation was admitted to  
having occurred by any parties. 
WENDELL 
She did say “government.” 
Scott glares at Leslie. 
LESLIE 
This can’t be happening. Andy, you’re  
suing your hometown?  
Andy starts to speak, then 

Andy, no. 
WENDELL 

Leslie starts to speak, then

Please come.

MARLENE 
You cut through the red tape? Why do you  
think red tape was invented, honey? To  
cover your ass. Red tape is our pants.  
LESLIE 
Mom, I went rogue. I went cowboy. Now I  
have to find a way to go reverse cowboy.

Oh, you didn’t. No! Not those clowns!  
They don’t know the first thing about our  
world.

It was like your stories of cocaine. 
MARLENE

Leslie, those were different times.  
Everyone in government was doing cocaine.  
It was like Snapple. And the money went  
to the CIA to kaboom the contras.

ANN 
The man lived in a pit, Leslie. He  
couldn’t find a place to live on the  
Earth’s surface. He ended up going under  
the ground. You’re dealing with a grown  
man who thinks like a gopher. 
LESLIE 
If I could get past the lawyers and find  
out what’s going on, I know I could get  
him to drop the lawsuit.  
Ann looks at her, then takes out her cellphone. As she  talks, Leslie realizes what she is doing and gets excited. 
ANN

Hey... Okay, calm down, yes it’s really  
me. We need to talk somewhere private...  
can you come over to my house later?  
She holds the phone away from her ear because of the EXCITED  SHOUTS.

That’s not how you said it, you were all

You are such a baby! Literally. You’re  
a naked baby. You need to grow up.

 INT. ANN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - N  
Leslie sits with Andy, who’s miserable. Andy wears a sheet,  tied like a skirt. 
LESLIE 
Andy, I’m sorry that I tricked you into  
coming here, but I can’t believe you’re  
suing just for the money. 
ANDY 
Well, I am completely broke and my lawyer  
thinks it could be worth a hundred  
thousand dollars.  
LESLIE 
You’re not that kind of person.  
Andy looks to camera. He could be that kind of person. 
 .  
   
LESLIE (CONT'D) 
What did you mean when you said you  
didn’t have any option? 
ANDY 
I really want Ann back, and she said she  
needed a guy with a lot of money. 
LESLIE 
That doesn’t sound like Ann. 
ANDY 
I can’t really do her voice, but she told  
me she liked Mark because he’s a grown-up  
with a bank account. See, that’s where  
that hundred thousand dollars could  
really come in handy. 
LESLIE 
It’s not about the money. It’s about how  
Mark makes the money -- he goes to work  
every day. He’s an adult. 
ANDY 
But I won’t need a job! I’ll have the  
money from the lawsuit! Everybody wins!  
LESLIE 
Ann will not respect you.  
ANDY 
She’ll respect my new Porsche that I’ll  
buy with the entire winnings. Have you  
ever met a guy who lives in a Porsche?  
You gotta respect that guy. 
LESLIE 
Andy, I promise you that will not work.  
Ann will not love you more if you live in  
a luxury sports car. You’re going to  
have to choose. The easy money, or Ann.  
Andy gets very quiet. He thinks for a long beat. 
ANDY 
If I don’t sue, I’m still on a couch with  
no job, no Ann, and no Porsche house. 
LESLIE 
Sometimes the right thing to do is to not  
take a shortcut. I wanted to fill in the  
pit, but that didn’t work out either. 
They sit there. 

 .  
    
ANDY 
Fine. I’ll get a job. Ann will respect  
that. I can make six bucks a day if I  
play my guitar on the street. 
(beat) 
I can’t make six bucks a day. 
LESLIE  
Um. Wait a second. I know I just said  
maybe shortcuts are bad, but I kind of  
just thought of an awesome shortcut.

 INT. PARKS DEPARTMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - D  
SCOTT 
Okay. What’s it going to take? 

 0.  
  
ANDY 
I have a list of conditions. 
(beat) 
One, I want the pit filled in. 
Beat. 
SCOTT 
...Is there a two? 
There isn’t. Andy improvises. 
ANDY 
A helicopter full of clones. 
SCOTT 
We can’t accomplish that. The technology  
isn’t ready.  
ANDY 
Fine. Then I suppose I’ll just settle  
for the pit being filled in. 
Scott sighs with relief and looks to Leslie with excitement --  “We got him!” 
LESLIE 
Well, Andy’s giving a little on the  
helicopter, so let’s meet him in the  
middle and fill in that pit. What do you  
say, Scott? 
SCOTT 
Well, of course we’re going to eventually  
fill in the pit.  
ANDY 
Eventually? I’ve already been injured  
twice in that thing. I could fall in ten  
more times by eventually. Every time I  
pass that pit it’s going to make me  
relive the most traumatic two different  
days of my life and want to sue again. 
LESLIE 
You know, Scott, I hate to say it, but it  
really seems like Andy has us over a  
barrel here. 
Scott looks stymied.

 EXT. ANN’S HOUSE - LATER - DAY   
Ann and Leslie stand behind a fence, watching as the pit is  filled in. Ann shakes her head, in wonder.  
ANN 
It’s really happening. I can’t believe  
it. I just can’t believe it! 
Leslie pinches Ann’s arm. 

Ow. 
ANN (CONT’D) LESLIE 

Oh -- sorry. Usually in these  
situations, people say “pinch me.” 
They continue to watch, smiling. Then Ann notices something. 
ANN 
Is that... Andy? 
REVEAL Andy in a hard hat, sitting in a deck chair close by  the pit, watching the proceedings. 
LESLIE 
(nonchalant) 
Oh, yeah. Just one of his conditions for  
the settlement. 
ANN 
He settled?! 
LESLIE 
Yup. Gave up probably a hundred thousand  
dollars for one thing the city fills in  
the pit behind your house.  

Why? 
ANN 
LESLIE 
(doesn’t want to push too hard) 

Who knows? Who knows why that gopher  
does anything he does. 
Ann takes this in. Andy looks over and sees them watching.  He waves. Ann smiles a little. Leslie notes this, then  looks back toward the pit. Muses.

LESLIE (CONT’D) 
Goodbye, pit. Hello, lot. 
(beat) 
What a beautiful word... lot. 
She smiles. 
 LESLIE TALKING HEAD  
LESLIE 
How does taking risks make me feel?  
Amazing. Tingling sensations all over my  
body. I feel flushed. My muscles are  
relaxed but I feel awake. Waves of  
pleasure. 
(beat) 
I wish there was something physical that  
could make me feel this way. 
(smiles and waves) 
Happy National Service Week, everyone!
