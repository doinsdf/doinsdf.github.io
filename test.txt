FADE IN:
EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
The campus of a large but humble community college a few
miles from your home. Cambridge bells chime.
Actually, the bells are playing on an old boom box, which is
now stopped by Dean PELTON [40s, rotund], who is holding a
microphone hooked up to it. He is on a small stage at the
front of the courtyard.
He starts to speak into the microphone, realizes it’s not
working and fiddles with the boombox switches. He begins to
speak, but a Busta Rhymes cd starts playing instead:
BUSTA RHYMES
(on cd)
Yo. I’m high as hell right now,
and I’m about to bust your ass
open, but first -
Pelton, an apparently humorless man, frantically figures out
how to stop the cd, then addresses the students.
PELTON
Good morning. Many of you are
halfway through your first week
here at Greendale and, as dean, I
thought I would share a word of
inspiration.
Pelton reads from a small stack of index cards:
PELTON (CONT’D)
What is Community College? Well,
you’ve heard all kinds of things.
You’ve heard it’s “loser college”
for young people who couldn’t make
the cut at a university.
ANNIE [18, tightly wound, sweater vest] is walking through
the courtyard when she hears this, causing her to stop.
TROY [18, letter jacket, All American], is seated on a bench
with a breakfast burrito. He looks up, a little put-off.
PELTON (CONT’D)
It’s “halfway school” for
twentysomething dropouts, crawling
back to society with unskilled
tails between their legs. 
BRITTA [late 20s, sweatshirt, pony tail, unadorned and
accidentally hot], is interrupted in her confident stride by
what she’s hearing. She stops and looks as if called by
name.
PELTON (CONT’D)
A tax-funded self esteem workshop
for newly divorced housewives
piecing together shattered
identities,
SHIRLEY [early 40s, shy, modest 90s attire], was briskly
crossing the courtyard, eyes cast downward. She stops and
looks toward the stage.
PELTON (CONT’D)
and old people hoping to keep their
minds active as they circle the
drain of eternity.
PIERCE [50s, prescription sunglasses, turtleneck, sport
jacket], was talking to a group of young people, but stops.
In fact, Pelton now has the undivided attention of most of
the pedestrians in the courtyard.
PELTON (CONT’D)
That’s what you’ve heard. However:
He flips to the next index card.
PELTON (CONT’D)
I wish you luck. Wait -
Confused, Pelton flips through his cards as the slightly
deflated students resume their activity. Pelton calls out to
them.
PELTON (CONT’D)
There was... a middle part of that
speech, if you see a card...
Walking amongst the rest of the students and not thrilled to
be doing so: JEFF Crocker, [30s, well dressed, dashing but
rough around the edges]. He is paced and orbited by ABED
[20s, Arabic, “geek chic” Weezer fan clothes], who seems
generally intrigued by everything all the time.
ABED
I’m only half Arabic, actually, my
Dad is Palestinian, I mean, he’s a
U.S.
2.
(MORE)
Citizen and he’s not a threat to
national security or anything, a
lot of people want to know that
after they meet him, because he has
an angry energy, but not like angry
at America, just angry at my Mom
for leaving him, although she did
leave because he was angry, and he
was angry because she was American.
My name’s Abed, by the way.
JEFF
Abed, nice to know you, and then
meet you, in that order. Now about
that question I had.
ABED
Oh.
(looks at watch)
Five after eleven. When you asked.
JEFF
Thanks. I’ll talk to you in a few
months, if that’s cool.
ABED
Oh. Few months. Okay.
Abed starts to walk away but Jeff puts a hand on his
shoulder.
JEFF
Hey, let me ask you.
Jeff pulls Abed closer and indicates someone in the distance:
It’s Britta, heading into the cafeteria.
JEFF (CONT’D)
The hot girl from Spanish class,
what’s her deal, I can’t find a
road in there.
ABED
Well, I’ve only talked to her once
while she was borrowing a pencil,
but her name’s Britta, she’s 28,
birthday in October, she has two
older brothers and one of them
works with children who have a
disorder I might want to look up.
Oh, and she thinks she’s going to
flunk tomorrow’s quiz so she really
needs to focus and she’s sorry if
that makes her seem cold.
3.
ABED (CONT'D)
JEFF
Abed, I see your value, now.
ABED
That’s the nicest thing anyone’s
ever said to me.
CUT TO:
INT. CAFETERIA
Britta moves down a food line, assembling her meal from bins
of saran wrapped items. Jeff gets in line next to her.
JEFF
Oh, hey. Spanish.
BRITTA
Yeah, just don’t hit on me, okay?
JEFF
Whoa.
BRITTA
And as you walk away, don’t call me
a lesbian or say “don’t flatter
yourself.”
JEFF
Anything I should do?
BRITTA
You should not hit on me.
JEFF
Listen, I just wanted to let you
know about my Spanish study group.
BRITTA
The guy that spent today’s class
playing Bejeweled on his iphone has
a study group? Am I allowed to
sign up twice?
JEFF
I’m taking that class for the easy
credit. I actually tutor Spanish.
She turns to him. On the hook but suspicious.
BRITTA
Say that in Spanish. Now.
4.
Jeff sighs, shouldering her cynicism with grace, and uses
gestures to indicate his mind, school and language:
JEFF
Duermo tarde Espanol, una hora mas,
no rayar mi coche.
Subtitle: I sleep late Spanish, one more hour, do not
scratch my car. She squints. Then surrenders.
BRITTA
I really need help with Spanish.
JEFF
I was willing to bet. I’m Jeff.
The group meets in the library at
six.
BRITTA
I’ll be there. I’m Britta. Thank
you so much, this is great.
Britta finishes paying for her food and walks away. Jeff
turns to the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN at the cash register.
JEFF
Technically, I am in college, so
it’s okay to use a college move,
right?
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
Huh?
JEFF
Sorry. I was raised on TV, I think
every black woman over fifty is a
cosmic mentor with free advice.
ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN
How about for two twenty five you
can have your damn tacos.
JEFF
Yes ma’am.
Jeff gets out his wallet.
FADE OUT.
5.
ACT I
FADE IN:
INT. SCIENCES BUILDING - DUNCAN’S OFFICE
Psychology Professor DUNCAN [30s, low calibre hippy] is
working at his desk in a small office lined with plants,
books and weird art. Jeff appears in his doorway.
JEFF
You’re a hard man to reach,
Professor.
Duncan takes a moment to place the face.
DUNCAN
Jeff Crocker? Attorney at law?
He stands and shakes Jeff’s hand.
JEFF
You remember.
DUNCAN
How could I forget? I still can’t
figure out how you got a jury to
connect September 11th with my DUI.
Let alone why it helped.
JEFF
2002 was a simpler time.
DUNCAN
What’s my lawyer doing on campus?
JEFF
I’m a student.
DUNCAN
That can’t be an inspiring journey.
Duncan goes to a dorm-sized fridge and grabs two beers.
JEFF
Eh, those ivy league twits on the
state bar have had me under a
microscope since I started.
They’ve suddenly decided that even
though I have a law degree, my
college degree isn’t “legitimate.”
Duncan hands Jeff one of the beers.
6.
DUNCAN
I thought you had a bachelor’s from
Columbia.
JEFF
And now I have to get one from
America. They must have noticed
the eagle in the seal was holding
coffee branches. I’m dead in the
water until I replace that degree.
DUNCAN
If you’re in my class, I hope
you’re not going to ask for special
treatment.
JEFF
Professor, please, I do have rules.
I would never take psychology, it’s
boring. But I was hoping that, as
a teacher, you could get me all the
quizzes, tests and exams for the
classes I am taking this semester.
Jeff places a sheet of paper on Duncan’s desk.
DUNCAN
Jeff, you just described - no,
defined cheating. Not only is it
illegal, it’s unethical.
He takes a drink of his own beer.
JEFF
Well, laws are tools. We reshape
them to suit the job. And you
seemed less concerned with ethics
the day I convinced twelve of your
peers that when you did a U turn on
a freeway and tried to order
chalupas from an emergency call
box, your only real crime was being
an American.
DUNCAN
You’re saying I owe you.
JEFF
I’m not saying that. I’m giving
you pieces of a puzzle, which, when
put together, form a picture of you
owing me.
Duncan gets somber. He surrenders.
7.
DUNCAN
I’ll look into it.
Jeff heads for the door.
JEFF
I’ll be in the library at six, but
by 6:20, my fake study group will
not have shown up and I’ll have to
take a very hot girl to dinner.
DUNCAN
Oh, Jeff. Don’t lie to women.
JEFF
(doesn’t care)
Whoops!
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY - STUDY ROOM
Jeff is seated at a big table, reading a Spanish text book.
JEFF
(repeating)
Bienvenido. Bienvenido.
Britta walks in. He smiles.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Bienvenido! Have a seat.
Jeff puts a notepad in front of her while she gets settled at
the room’s large table.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You can put your contact info on
here. I guess the group is running
late, but we can get acquainted.
She writes some stuff on the pad.
BRITTA
You may have noticed this morning,
I’m not great at small talk.
JEFF
I want to talk big. I want to
know, what’s your deal?
BRITTA
That’s not small talk?
8.
JEFF
What’s your deal and IS GOD DEAD?!
BRITTA
Alright. My deal. I dropped out
of high school to pursue my love of
anarchy. I made a lot of new
friends vandalizing billboards, I
helped coordinate us into a very
large, successful movement of
anarchist billboard vandals, and we
decided I was the leader, which
meant we had to kick me out,
because we were anarchists. Soon
after, they became an advertising
firm. One of their shampoo
billboards is across the street.
JEFF
The one that says “hey, it’s your
hair, we just want to clean it?”
BRITTA
Power to the people. And you can
go on Facebook and see photos of
their children, who have names like
Hemingway and Chomsky and who are
seated in the backs of SUVs. So I
guess my deal is, be honest with me
and I’ll like you. Because I may
be broke and “crawling back to
society” but I’m doing it having
learned that what’s most important
to me is honesty.
JEFF
(concern)
Good thing to learn.
BRITTA
What’s most important to you?
JEFF
I would say...honesty, because...
(surrender)
I would say anything to get what I
want and I want you to like me.
BRITTA
Very honest answer. So you get
your wish. I like you fine.
Jeff blinks.
9.
JEFF
Oh.
BRITTA
Yeah, see how easy.
JEFF
That’s it, huh? No Looney Tunes
character tattooed on your hip I
have to pretend to love?
BRITTA
Not me. Buy me dinner, don’t lie
to me and we’ll be in bed before
midnight.
The two of them chuckle at her joke.
JEFF
- All kidding aside, if you’re
hungry -
Abed enters. Britta looks as though she was expecting him.
BRITTA
Abed’s in the house! Whoooo!
JEFF
(good fake enthusiasm)
Whooooo, Abed! Also whyyyyy?
ABED
Britta invited me, is that cool?
JEFF
(plastered smile)
I can’t think of a single logical
reason why not. Have a seat. And
put your contact info here.
Abed sits down to write on the notepad.
ABED
Cool cool cool cool.
(while writing)
Hey, this is kind of like Breakfast
Club, huh?
BRITTA
(supporting it)
We’re in a library.
With great precision, Jeff reads Abed’s cell number while
punching it into his own phone under the table.
10.
ABED
Well, yeah, and we’re students,
from different backgrounds, and I’m
sure we’ve each got a thing, like
an issue, all balled up inside of
us that would make us cry if we
talked about it.
Jeff thumbs something into his phone.
BRITTA
Do you have something balled up
inside you want to talk about?
ABED
(thinks about it)
Oh, I got a little doozy in the
chamber I can let loose if things
get emotional.
Abed’s phone beeps. His reaction makes Jeff nervous.
ABED (CONT’D)
Whoa! Text message. Let’s give
this bad boy a read.
Abed picks up his phone.
JEFF
I’m sure it’s personal -
ABED
- No, I don’t know this person.
(clears throat)
“Say you have to pee I need to talk
to you.”
Jeff pretends to digest it along with the other two, all of
them exchanging confused looks.
ABED (CONT’D)
“Say you have to pee?”
BRITTA
Weird.
JEFF
Yeah. Creepy.
Professor Duncan ducks his head into the room, sees Jeff,
then sees the others.
DUNCAN
Jeffrey, a quick word? About
psychology?
11.
JEFF
I’ll be right back. When it’s
about psychology, it’s urgent.
Jeff heads for the door.
BRITTA
What if the group shows up?
JEFF
They’ll know what to do.
CUT TO:
EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - DUSK
A motley crew of would-be athletes are trying out for the
apparently all-ages track team. Currently, a ninety year old
man is prepping himself on the starting line.
Jeff and Duncan are standing out in the middle of the field.
DUNCAN
I could get fired for having this
conversation, so act like you’re
watching the athletic proceedings.
JEFF
You couldn’t stop me from watching.
There is a man trying out for your
track team that is older than the
game of poker.
(noticing)
And he’s kinda truckin’.
DUNCAN
Suppose I did feel indebted to you,
Jeff. And suppose I said it was
possible to get you these answers.
JEFF
I’d say go for it. And, for future
reference, you can ask me stuff
like that way closer to wherever
we’re originally standing.
DUNCAN
I’m asking if you understand the
difference between right and wrong.
12.
JEFF
I understand “right” and “wrong”
are slippery slopes that end with
presidents who don’t believe
dinosaurs existed. And I’ve
understood since I was a kid that
if I talked long enough, I could
make anything true. So either I’m
God or truth is relative, and in
either case: booyah.
DUNCAN
Interesting. The average person
has a harder time saying “booyah”
to moral relativism.
JEFF
Ian, you don’t have to play shrink
to protect your pride, I accept
that you’re a chicken.
DUNCAN
Are you trying to use reverse
psychology on a psychologist?
JEFF
I’m just using normal psychology on
a pussy.
DUNCAN
You can’t talk to me that way!
JEFF
A six year old girl could talk to
you that way!
DUNCAN
Because it would be adorable!
JEFF
No, because you’re a five year old
girl, and there’s a pecking order!
DUNCAN
FINE, I’LL DO IT!
COACH BARTEL (O.S.)
- Gentlemen.
COACH BARTEL [stocky, 40s] is approaching their exchange.
13.
COACH BARTEL (CONT’D)
This is an athletic field, not a
rehearsal of Glengarry Glen Ross,
and I should know, because I run
both the Sports and Theatre
departments. Take it elsewhere.
Jeff and Duncan start walking off the field together. Coach
Bartel calls after them:
COACH BARTEL (CONT’D)
Either of you guys play football?
It’s looking that bad this year.
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY - STUDY ROOM
Jeff enters, feigning disappointment.
JEFF
Well, I just found out that the
rest of the group -
Britta is not at the table, but Abed is, along with four new
students: Pierce, Shirley, Troy and Annie. They look at him.
JEFF (CONT’D)
- is here?
ABED
Britta’s in the bathroom, I think,
and I invited more people from
Spanish class, is that cool?
Jeff raises a fist that immediately becomes a thumbs-up.
JEFF
It’s the coolest. I should go to
the bathroom, too. And I should
bring my jacket, keys and wallet in
case there’s a fire.
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY - LOBBY
Jeff is on his way to the exit doors. He nearly collides
with Britta, who is entering the lobby.
BRITTA
Ah. Busted.
(confiding)
14.
(MORE)
I barely smoke. But that group is
getting big, made me skittish, I
started craving a grit.
JEFF
Same here. I saw those faces and I
just had to ...suck a ..leaf tube,
(hail Mary)
Maybe you and I would get more
studying done over -
Britta laughs at the proposition.
BRITTA
- Dinner? Come on, we both know
that’s when the studying stops.
Let’s do this thing first.
She starts walking away, then adds:
BRITTA (CONT’D)
If it really turns out to be a
train wreck, we’ll slip out early.
She walks away. Jeff mulls this over.
JEFF
Oh. I can do a train wreck.
OLD BLACK WOMAN (O.S.)
What a tangled web we weave.
Jeff is startled to see the old black woman from the
cafeteria next to him in the lobby. She’s placing books on a
cart, unloading the overnight return bin.
JEFF
Don’t you work in the cafeteria?
OLD BLACK WOMAN
I have many jobs. In many places.
Jeff’s jaw drops. She rolls her eyes at him.
OLD BLACK WOMAN (CONT’D)
I’m not magical, I’m underpaid.
You racist jackass.
JEFF
Sorry.
Jeff heads back to the study room, ready for action.
FADE OUT.
15.
BRITTA (CONT'D)
ACT II
FADE IN:
INT. STUDY ROOM
Jeff settles into his chair at the head of the table. He
looks around the room. There’s Britta, there’s Abed, there’s
Annie the type-A teen, Troy the meat head jock, Shirley the
closed-up ex-housewife and Pierce the weird old man with
neatly brushed grey hair and some kind of stone around his
neck he must have bought at a tarot card store.
JEFF
Alllll right. Look at this crew.
Alllll ready to study alllll night.
Everyone concurs.
JEFF (CONT’D)
But who studies with strangers,
right? We’re all in the same
class and we don’t even know each
other, my name is Jeff.
Pierce speaks. He talks kind of like George Takei.
PIERCE
Jeff, it’s a pleasure, my name is
Pierce Hawthorne and yes, that is
Hawthorne as in Hawthorne Wipes,
the award winning moist towelette.
JEFF
I was just going to ask.
PIERCE
I’m also a Rotarian and no stranger
to public speaking so maybe I
should make the introductions. You
already know Britter. Brittles?
BRITTA
Britta.
PIERCE
My apologies Britta, you also know
A-bed, A-bed the A-reb, is that
inappropriate?
ABED
(as if asked to get ice)
Sure.
16.
PIERCE
We’ve got Roy, Roy, the wonder boy
I call him, -
TROY
- Troy.
PIERCE
You are correct, and little
princess Elizabeth, -
ANNIE
Annie.
PIERCE
Very sorry, and finally this
beautiful creature’s name is
Shirley.
JEFF
(to Shirley)
Is that even close?
Shirley nods.
PIERCE
One does not forget Shirley, she is
a very, very fascinating, very
gorgeous young woman.
Shirley does not appear to enjoy the flattery. Jeff makes a
mental note. Annie speaks up.
ANNIE
I’d like to know why I had to find
out about this group on accident.
ABED
Oh, this is getting way more like
Breakfast Club, now.
BRITTA
We should get started studying -
Jeff goes into action, seeing an opening for his crowbar.
JEFF
You know, I’ve been part of a lot
of study groups that fell apart
because of unaddressed tension.
Shouldn’t someone address Annie’s
concern? Did we not invite her?
17.
SHIRLEY
Well, Annie, sweetie, I guess it
didn’t occur to anyone -
ANNIE
- That’s strange, because I
remember the first day of class, I
asked if anyone was interested in
starting a Spanish study group, and
passed around a sign-up sheet, and
when it came back, all that was on
it was a drawing of a unicorn with
a wiener instead of a horn, a
guitar for a wiener and a dog
emerging from its rear.
BRITTA
That was a cat and he was going in.
(off her look)
What? Everyone added something.
ANNIE
Yes, and then gathered behind my
back for a study group!
SHIRLEY
Pumpkin, it’s not behind your back,
we just didn’t think about you.
ANNIE
Can we stop with the pumpkins and
the sweeties? Being younger
doesn’t make me inferior, if
anything, your age indicates you’ve
made bad life decisions.
SHIRLEY
(simmering)
Mmmmmmmm.
JEFF
(seizing opportunity)
Shirley has a response to that.
SHIRLEY
No, I don’t.
The entire room encourages her to respond.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Well, I’m sure I’ve made bad life
decisions.
18.
(MORE)
I decided to spend twenty years
raising children and cleaning up
after a man who ran out the door
ten minutes after winning one-ohtwo-point-seven thousand dollars in
a radio contest. That was a bad
decision. And maybe Annie’s
decisions will be better. And I
think she should decide whether she
wants to be considered a child or
an adult, because a child gets
pity, but not respect, and adults
can get respect but they can also
get grabbed by the hair and have
their faces put through jukeboxes.
BRITTA
(blurting)
Seriously!
Britta quickly composes herself. Annie pouts. Shirley
regains her shyness. Pierce gives her head a supportive
stroke, causing her to wince. Jeff points a pen at Pierce,
shifting to what he hopes is even more fertile ground for
sowing discontent.
JEFF
Pierce, let’s discuss this
creepiness.
PIERCE
I beg your pardon?
JEFF
Are you unaware Shirley finds your
advances inappropriate?
PIERCE
What advances?
SHIRLEY
You have been sexually harassing me
since the first day of class!
PIERCE
“Sexually harassing?” That doesn’t
make sense, why would I “harass”
someone that turns me on?
TROY
Saying she turns you on is the
harrassment, buddy.
Pierce slams the table with his fist.
19.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
PIERCE
I am a business leader and a
community pillar and I don’t take
courting advice from teenage boys!
TROY
Well this teenage boy is a
quarterback and a prom king, so
maybe you should!
ANNIE
You’re not prom king anymore, Troy,
this isn’t Greendale High.
TROY
How did you know I went there?
ANNIE
Because you’re wearing your stupid
letter jacket and more importantly
I SAT BEHIND YOU IN ALGEBRA!
TROY
Wait, are you the girl that got
hooked on pills and dropped out?
You’re Little Annie Adderall!
ANNIE
And you’re a stupid jock that lost
his scholarship because he
celebrated getting it with a keg
stand and dislocated both
shoulders!
ABED
I’m ready! I’m ready!
Everyone looks at Abed.
ABED (CONT’D)
I bought one of those big binders
to store my DVDs in. And I left it
in the sun, and the plastic sleeves
melted to the discs, and they’re
all unplayable and it’s my fault!
Abed starts sobbing real tears. Everyone watches, confused.
JEFF
That’s your Breakfast Club doozy?
ABED
(through sobs)
I love cinema!
20.
Jeff’s phone rings. He answers.
JEFF
Hello?
A very low voice from the other end:
DUNCAN (V.O.)
(on phone)
It’s Professor Duncan. Come to the
parking lot. Now.
JEFF
What’s wrong with your voice?
DUNCAN (V.O.)
(on phone)
I’m disguising it.
JEFF
I’ll be right there.
Jeff hangs up.
BRITTA
Now where are you going?
JEFF
It’s an emergency. You guys need
to hash this stuff out anyway,
because we can’t study with all
this stuff seething under the
surface. I just hope at least one
of you is here when I get back.
CUT TO:
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Jeff enters the parking lot, looking around.
DUNCAN (O.S.)
Hello, Jeff.
Duncan emerges from between two cars, holding a large, thick
envelope.
DUNCAN (CONT’D)
Every answer to every test in your
curriculum this semester.
JEFF
You are the best.
21.
Jeff reaches for the package. Duncan withholds it.
DUNCAN
But what do I get?
JEFF
I thought we had a deal.
DUNCAN
Deals are bound by ethics, Jeff.
Deals are for five year old girls.
JEFF
What do you want.
DUNCAN
Your Lexus.
JEFF
HA! My luxury sedan for a
semester’s worth of answers?
DUNCAN
Come on, you’re never going to stop
taking the easy way out. I’ll be
helping you for four years. You
want to get a degree while taking
naps? I want leather seats with
built-in ball warmers. Offer
expires in ten seconds.
JEFF
I’m supposed to do what, walk home?
DUNCAN
Take my Prius.
Duncan holds up some keys.
JEFF
PRIUS?
DUNCAN
It’s good for the Earth.
JEFF
So is wiping your butt with a leaf
but it’s not how a man gets around!
DUNCAN
Time’s up.
Duncan starts to walk away. Jeff panics.
22.
JEFF
Alright!
CUT TO:
INT. LIBRARY
Jeff heads across the library toward the study room, carrying
Duncan’s packet.
Britta opens the door and comes running to him. We can hear
chaos coming from the room behind her.
BRITTA
It’s really bad in there.
JEFF
Yeah, sounds like a train wreck.
What do you say? Time to go?
BRITTA
Go? Jeff, I would rather flunk
Spanish and starve to death than
abandon a group of people in pain.
Jeff stares at her for a beat, then:
JEFF
You thought I meant time to go to
dinner? I meant time to go give
these people the healing they need.
Time to spread the love, time to
set everything back to exactly the
way it was before they got here.
She gives his arm one of those platonic but lingering touches
that women have been using to secretly control civilization
for 50,000 years. As she heads back to the room, Jeff adds
carefully:
JEFF (CONT’D)
Then dinner.
FADE OUT.
23.
ACT III
FADE IN:
INT. STUDY ROOM
Jeff walks in. Everyone is sitting with their arms folded,
staring at the table in front of them.
JEFF
How’s it going in here?
Everyone explodes into furious name calling and arguing.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Alright, alright. Simmer down! I
want to tell you something!
They quiet down. He squares himself. Closing argument time.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You know what makes humans
different from other animals? We
are the only species on Earth that
observes Shark Week. Sharks don’t
even have Shark Week, but we do.
For the same reason I can pick up
this pencil, tell you its name is
Steve, then go like this
(snaps pencil)
And part of you dies just a little
inside. Because humans can connect
to anything. We can sympathize
with a pencil, we can forgive a
shark, we can give Ben Affleck an
Academy Award for screenwriting.
Everyone nods knowingly, touched. Britta, however, remains
poker-faced.
JEFF (CONT’D)
People can find the good in just
about anything but themselves.
Look at me. It’s obvious to all of
you that I’m awesome, and yet, if I
agreed with you, I would be an ass.
But I can think Annie’s awesome in
ways that I’m not. She’s driven.
Some people have to be driven or
the power goes off and the ice
cream melts. And look at Pierce.
24.
(MORE)
Other guys his age are locked up in
their houses yelling at the people
on TV for farting, this guy is out
here, with us, even though he’s
earned the right to dismiss us.
Just like Shirley’s earned a little
elbow room, and a lot of respect,
not as a wife, not as a mother,
it’s time for her to be a woman,
and don’t test her on that, because
that thing about the jukebox was
way too specific to be improvised,
we want her on our side when we
rumble with the other study groups.
The group murmurs in enthusiastic agreement. Troy nods at
Shirley. Shirley smiles.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You want Troy, too. That’s why
we’re tempted to dis the jacket,
because it’s a symbol that
intimidates us, you think
astronauts go to the moon because
they hate oxygen, come on, they’re
trying to impress their high
school’s prom king, and well they
should, because I saw our track
team tonight and I’m pretty sure
Troy’s gonna be a big dog on
campus. And Abed. You know, God
made people with minds that wander
because the answers we need are
barely ever the ones we’re asking.
Abed’s a shaman, ask him to pass
the salt, you get a bowl of soup,
and guess what, soup is better.
Abed is better.
(beat)
You’re all better than you think
you are. You’re just not designed
to believe it when you hear it from
yourself. So everybody, do me a
favor, look to the person on the
left.
Everybody does it.
JEFF (CONT’D)
I want you to extend to that person
the same compassion you extend to
sharks, pencils and Ben Affleck. I
want you to say to that person, “I
forgive you.” Go ahead.
25.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Everyone says “I forgive you.”
JEFF (CONT’D)
Now look at me.
Everyone looks at Jeff.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You just stopped being a study
group. You have now become
something unstoppable. I hereby
pronounce you a community.
Abed wipes at some tears.
ABED
It’s not like Breakfast Club
anymore. Now it’s like Stripes, or
Meatballs. Anything with Bill
Murray, really.
JEFF
I agree with Abed that tonight has
been very special. Too special for
Spanish, really, and I think that,
like the Breakfast Club, we ought
to disband and reflect.
Jeff looks at Britta and nods his head slightly toward the
door, like, “let’s go.”
Britta looks at Jeff. She looks around the room at all the
mesmerized faces. Finally, she announces her decision while
watching Jeff carefully.
BRITTA
Actually, now that we’re
unstoppable, it’ll probably take no
time at all to prepare for this
quiz, right?
Everyone agrees with that. They’re very excited about
studying, now. Jeff goes to plan C.
JEFF
I have a surprise for you guys. We
don’t need to study. I have all
the tests and answers for the
semester.
Jeff shows the packet he got from Duncan.
JEFF (CONT’D)
So. All done.
26.
Everyone at the table is a bit taken aback. Britta narrows
her eyes on him. Pierce puzzles through this.
PIERCE
Well, Jeff, now, why in Hell’s
Bells would you want to enroll in a
community college to cheat?
JEFF
I didn’t want to enroll here,
Pierce, I have to be here. I’m a
lawyer. I mean, I was a lawyer,
and I’d like to get back to being
one as soon as possible.
BRITTA
(gross)
A lawyer...
TROY
Then why have a study group?
JEFF
I DON’T HAVE A STUDY GROUP! YOU
PEOPLE JUST SHOWED UP!
Britta explains something to everyone she’d been putting
together for a while.
BRITTA
It was all to get in my pants.
JEFF
Why can’t you see that for the
compliment that it is?
ANNIE
What about the look left speech?
Was that real?
JEFF
I learned it at tennis camp when I
was seven.
Everyone is dismayed and disappointed.
JEFF (CONT’D)
I added the Ben Affleck references!
BRITTA
Jeff, you had me at “I’m a lawyer,”
and by had me, I mean had me ready
to puke. Now please leave and let
us study before my gag reflex hits
a tipping point.
27.
JEFF
But you’re not listening, I have
the answers.
Britta physically gags.
Abed shakes his head.
ABED
I thought you were like Bill Murray
in any of his films. But you’re
really like Michael Douglas in any
of his.
JEFF
Yeah, well, you have Asperger’s.
As Jeff exits, everyone recoils in shock and comforts a
confused Abed.
BRITTA
He is not qualified to make that
diagnosis.
CUT TO:
EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT
Jeff exits the front doors, miffed, sour grapey, opening
Duncan’s packet.
He gets the envelope open and pulls out a stack of papers
from inside. He looks at them, stunned.
We watch as Jeff flips through a stack of pages from old
Psychology Today magazines.
CUT TO:
INT. DUNCAN’S OFFICE
Professor Duncan is enjoying a pipe in his office and seems
to have been expecting Jeff to burst through the door, which
Jeff now does.
DUNCAN
Before you react, you’ll want to
think about the gift you’ve been
given.
JEFF
An excuse to punch a hippy?
28.
DUNCAN
A second chance at an honest life.
A life that starts here at
Greendale. All these tricks you
acquired to survive out there, they
have no use in this place that
you’re wiping your feet on. People
here are excited and proud to be
here, students and faculty alike.
And frankly, we’re a little
offended by the implication that
there’s anywhere else we’d like to
be. This is a lesson you need to
learn, Jeff.
Jeff shrugs.
JEFF
Well, I’m...I’m sorry, but I’m not
getting it.
DUNCAN
Maybe you’re incapable of learning.
JEFF
Is it possible you’re incapable of
teaching? It is community college.
Now give me my keys or it’s going
to get sloppy.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT
Jeff stomps across the empty night time campus of Greendale
community college. So fucked.
He sees the Old Black Woman sitting on one of the benches
that is just outside the library entrance. He starts walking
to her. She’s clearly bummed out about this. He stands by
her for a moment, mustering the confession:
JEFF
I don’t know how to do it.
OLD BLACK WOMAN
I don’t care.
She gets up.
JEFF
Where are you going?
OLD BLACK WOMAN
(sarcastic)
Don’t you know, honey child?
29.
(MORE)
I gots to go polish that moon and
hang them clouds out to dry. But
don’t you worry. Outer space Jesus
negro lady is watching over you.
Jeff slumps down on the bench as she walks away.
JEFF
Great. Even God thinks I’m a dick.
He sits there for a moment. Puts his head back.
Pierce emerges from the library’s front doors, sees Jeff, and
pauses to take in the night air.
PIERCE
Boy. There is Autumn, and then
there is just Fall.
JEFF
You may have purchased a knockoff
calendar.
PIERCE
You said some nice things about me
up there, Jeffrey.
Pierce sits on another bench across from him.
PIERCE (CONT’D)
And I do admit, I’ve got things to
learn about the ladies. You know
I’ve been married seven times? I’m
starting to think I’m doing
something wrong.
JEFF
Do I look like I’m in a position to
give romantic advice right now?
Troy comes out of the library, sees them both and nods.
TROY
Hey.
JEFF
I thought you guys were studying.
TROY
We’re done.
JEFF
Oh. That was fast.
Troy sits next to him, curious.
30.
OLD BLACK WOMAN (CONT'D)
TROY
Let me ask you something. People
have been clowning me about this
jacket since I got here. But if I
take it off to make them happy, I’m
weak, right?
JEFF
(shrug)
Troy, what’s it matter. You lose
the jacket to please them, you keep
it to piss them off...either way,
it’s for them, that’s what’s weak.
TROY
(epiphany)
Whoa.
(bigger epiphany)
Whoa.
(confusion)
Wait, but -
(realization)
Whoa!
PIERCE
He’s good, isn’t he?
TROY
My brain’s all wrinkly.
Jeff doesn’t necessarily mind the praise, but he’s still got
wallowing to do.
Shirley and Annie come through the doors together. Annie
stops when she sees the boys sitting together.
ANNIE
Is this another “we hate Annie”
meeting?
SHIRLEY
Oh, sweetie. Nobody hates you.
(catching it)
Sorry I called you sweetie, it’s a
mother’s habit -
ANNIE
- It’s not that bad, really.
(almost crying)
My parents, um -
(clears throat)
This is interesting architecture.
Abed and Britta come through the library doors.
31.
ABED
Oh, hey, everybody.
Britta is not excited to see Jeff.
BRITTA
Shouldn’t you be at home rolling
around on a bed covered with quiz
answers?
Jeff tosses the envelope to her. She looks at the contents.
BRITTA (CONT’D)
Ha! Live by the sword, huh Amigo?
(explaining)
Amigo means “friend.” You might
need to know that for tomorrow.
Jeff nods, resigned to his fate.
JEFF
I want to say something.
Jeff starts to say something. Then stops. He gets a weird
look on his face.
JEFF (CONT’D)
But nothing I say is true, so...I
can’t...
He struggles. Then, finally:
JEFF (CONT’D)
Sorry. I need help.
He buries his face in his hands.
JEFF (CONT’D)
I’m gonna flunk. I need help.
The group looks around at each other. Mostly, they’re all
looking at Britta.
Shirley looks at Britta with a face that says “do something.”
Britta looks at Shirley with a “What? Me?” face. She
indicates Jeff and makes a gagging gesture.
Shirley makes a gesture that means “give me a break and maybe
also get over yourself because there are worse things in the
world than men making asses of themselves over you.”
Troy gestures insistently. So does Pierce. Abed is
confused.
32.
ABED
What’s going on? Can you guys hear
me? Am I deaf?
Jeff looks up, curious to see what Abed is talking about.
Britta makes a decision. She addresses the group.
BRITTA
Hey, um. We should, um.
(clears throat)
We should get back upstairs, and
finish, right?
Jeff is confused.
JEFF
I thought you were done.
BRITTA
Who said that? Are we done?
PIERCE
I’m not done.
Everyone agrees they’re not done. Abed is more confused.
BRITTA
Well, let’s go. Jeff, you coming?
Jeff is taken aback by the offer.
JEFF
Are you serious? I can study with
you guys?
BRITTA
Eh. You know. If you want. I
don’t care.
Jeff stands up, recovering from his depression.
JEFF
That’s the nicest thing anyone’s
ever said to me.
The group heads back for the library entrance as we pull back
in a crane shot that, like this campus, packs a lot of
emotional punch for a reasonable price.

for filling out your anonymous *

there was one of you whose *

JEFF and SHIRLEY walk in the same direction down the hall.
SHIRLEY
Nice day out today, isn’t it?
JEFF
(like he forgot something)
Yeah. Oh. Damn.
Jeff starts back towards the classroom as Shirley walks off.
He runs into BRITTA.
BRITTA
Forget something?
JEFF
Yeah, I forgot to stagger the
timing of my exit with Shirley’s.

We both have an eleven o’clock all *

Jeff and Britta walk together, out of the school building and
onto the quad. *
BRITTA
I find Shirley very easy to talk
to. And aren’t you supposed to
have, like, an olympic gold medal
in jibber jabber?
JEFF
Yeah, but I’m a sprinter, I’m at my
best during high speed bursts of
wit. You lock me into Shirley’s
stride for a marathon banter about
her brownies? The awkward silence
is going to set in before we pass
the stoner tree.
We see a tree where stoners are hanging out. VAUGHN, a hot,
laid-back guy, plays hackey sack with no socks on and his *
shirt in his back pocket.
VAUGHN
Hey, Britta. Hi. ‘Sup?
BRITTA
Hey, Vaughn. How’s it going?
VAUGHN
No worries.
JEFF
(to Britta)
Interesting. Cause I might worry
if I played hackey sack a decade *
too late.
BRITTA
My class is this way. *
JEFF *
Alright, but I just wanted to point *
out that we easily walked more than *
a hundred yards without a single *
awkward pause, and that’s the mark *
of a true friend. So, nice walking *

ANNIE runs up to PROFESSOR DUNCAN who is in line to pay.
ANNIE
Professor Duncan. Annie Edison, *
I’m in your 101 lecture, I’ve heard *
about your special psych lab -- *
PROF. DUNCAN *
Ah. The Duncan Principle.
ANNIE *
Yes, and I know it’s limited to *
second year students, but I had a *
4.0 at Riverside High, and I’m not *
looking down on this school at all, *
but I’m only here because of a *
brief addiction to pills that I was *
told would help me focus but they *
actually made me lose my *
scholarship and virginity. If I *
could take your lab early, it would *
be a real feather in my transcript. *
PROF. DUNCAN
I’ve been in this situation many
times, so I’m going to be up front.
I’m not allowed to date students. *
Even though you are an eight, a *
British ten. If, in spite of that, *
you’re still interested, you may
join the lab.
Annie jumps.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
You need to bring two human
subjects. It also wouldn’t hurt *
your chances if you could lend me a
fiver.
(while she gets one)
I seem to have left my purse in my
duffle, and my duffle in the boot

Annie hands him five dollars.

A4 INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS A4
Jeff, ABED, PIERCE, Shirley, and TROY at a table near the
coffee stand. Jeff looks on as Britta stands in the coffee
line talking with Vaughn. Pierce makes a meal out of opening
his express package.
PIERCE
What could this express package be?
Someone needed to get me something fast.
SHIRLEY
You brought your mail to campus?
PIERCE
Didn’t have time to open it at home.
JEFF
Plus, if you opened it at home, we
wouldn’t be able to see whatever it
is you want us to see.
PIERCE
(opening package)
Oh, yes. My Ear-Noculars.
JEFF
Perfect.
TROY
What is that? It looks like your
Bluetooth thingie.
Pierce turns his head. He has a Bluetooth headset in one ear.
PIERCE
No no no. This is my cell phone
headset. This is Ear-Noculars.
It’s for spies and what have you.
It gives you sonic hearing.
ABED
All hearing is sonic.
PIERCE
(not hearing)
What’s that?
JEFF
You might want to take that ear
thing for a spin.
Pierce looks through the Ear-Noculars literature.
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 4.
PIERCE
This is great. I’ll be able to
hear a violin from the balcony or
the doorbell ring when I’m out
gardening.
JEFF
So, it’s a hearing aid.
PIERCE
(snapping)
No!
(composes himself)
A hearing aid is for people who
can’t hear. Ear-Noculars are for
people who can’t hear enough.
TROY
(reading box)
Eyes for your ears. That’s freaky.
Annie approaches.
ANNIE
So who wants to be in a psych
experiment?
Pierce has his Ear-Noculars on, unaware of Annie.
PIERCE
Guys, guys,...
(conspiratorial)
Annie’s talking... about some kind
of experiment.
JEFF
She’s behind you.
(to Annie)
Not interested.
ANNIE
Come on, this is huge for me. I’d
be the first Freshman to sit in on
Professor Duncan’s experiment.
JEFF
Is it the one where he proves that
if you drink enough scotch, you
forget you’re not driving in
England?

No, Jeff. It’s supposed to be mindblowing. Pleeeease? You get paid.

Everyone but Annie looks at Troy, who minds his lunch,
oblivious.

Yay! How about you, Abed? It’s

ABED
Oof. Tomorrow? They’re showing
all four Indiana Jones’s at The
Vista. I was really looking
forward to the first three. I
bought a whip.
She stops walking and turns to face him, with puppy dog eyes.
ANNIE
This is really important to me,
Abed. Could you please go as my
friend. My really good friend?
ABED
Wow, I didn’t realize we were really
good friends. I figured we were more
like Chandler and Phoebe. They
never really had stories together.
Sure, I’ll do it, Chandler.
ANNIE
(hugging Abed)
Oh, thank you, Abed.
SHIRLEY
That’s nice.
Off Shirley’s “that’s nice,” Jeff looks for Britta and
notices she’s still talking with Vaughn.
JEFF
(getting up)
I better save Britta from that
dude.
SHIRLEY
Yeah, she looks like she’s in
trouble. I hope he doesn’t
“handsome” her to death.
Shirley watches Jeff approach Britta and Vaughn.
JEFF
Hey.
VAUGHN
Hi, what’s up, hey. I’m Vaughn.
Man, those shoes look comfortable.

VAUGHN
Nah, just chillin. Hey, you’re not

JEFF
No, I was just seeing if Britta...
VAUGHN
Hey, no judgement at all, brah. I
used to do coffee, but then I
switched to green tea and it’s like
filled with antioxidants and stuff.
It’s pretty tight.
JEFF
(to Britta)
Tight, yes. I’ve heard that about
green tea.
Britta doesn’t look at Jeff. She smiles at Vaughn.
BRITTA
I like green tea. I should make
the change.
Back at the table, Pierce observes Britta and speaks
studiously while touching his bionic ear.
PIERCE
Britta’s making the change to green
tea.

Prof. Duncan winks. Annie titters excitedly.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
The waiting is the experiment. The *
Duncan Principle is simple: The
more control lost by - actually, I *
should take this down, too. *
(takes his own notes) *
The more control lost by the ego, *
the more gained by the id,
resulting in a surprisingly
predictable emotional eruption or *
breaking point, *
(southern accent) *
known to ma and pa as a “tantrum.” *
(waits for chuckle, gets
it)
Annie, please let our subjects know *
that the experiment will start in
five minutes.
A smiling Annie crosses to the door.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
(whispering to everyone)
But it’s never going to start. *
Educated titters. Annie waves her hand over her face, going
from a smile to a serious face. She opens the door into the
waiting room.

Jeff exits the school building with Shirley and some other
students. He bends down to tie his shoe, hoping Shirley will
keep walking. When he stands, she is right there.
SHIRLEY
Did you know we walk the same way
after class? I’m sure you didn’t
or else we would’ve been walking
together, unless you’re a jerk,
just kidding.
JEFF
Ha. Let’s do it.
Jeff starts walking with her.
SHIRLEY
Oh hold on now, going a little too
fast for these dogs.
The walk is even slower. Long, awkward silence. They both *
try to break it.
JEFF (CONT’D)
You have a kid, right?
SHIRLEY
How do you like Greendale?
SHIRLEY (CONT’D) *
What’s that?

Nothing.

Shirley giggles. *
SHIRLEY
You better be careful, he might be
listening with his Inspector Gadget

JEFF *
I do know that show. *
SHIRLEY *
Oh, and how about that Hackey Sack
guy? Always around, flirting with
Britta. It’s embarrassing.
JEFF *
(too loud)
I know! He’s the worst! *
SHIRLEY *
I mean, what is with that hair?
JEFF
It’s perpetually moist. And the
incessant evangelizing of green
tea. No offense, but if I want
medical advice, I’ll get it from
someone wearing socks.
Shirley loves that one. They continue gabbing. *
8 INT. EXPERIMENT ROOM - LATER 8
Prof. Duncan stands in front of the monitor. He checks his
watch.

ANGLE ON the monitor: Prof. Duncan fast forwards the tape.
We start with a room full of subjects. Over time, we see
Annie pop in and out of the room. One after another,
frustrated subjects get up and leave. (The research
assistants take notes.)
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
(commenting on what he
sees)
Look at this one. He’s a
stomper... This one’s a screamer...
We got a bulemic... Look at the
little one chase the big one, it’s
like Benny Hill... Fore!... Ooh,
he just hit that girl...
On the tape, all that remain now are Abed and Troy. Abed
remains motionless while Troy slowly melts down and exits. *
Abed is the only one left. He sits patiently, hands folded
in his lap. Prof. Duncan leans closer to the screen.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
Ah, I’ve seen this before. The
longer they wait, the harder they
break. Buckle up, students.
(then, noticing)
Does he have a whip?
9 EXT. QUAD - LATER 9
Shirley and Jeff sit on the bench, laughing.
SHIRLEY
Oh, and have you seen how often
Hackey Sack takes his shirt off? *
He’d play shirts and skins in a

I am so glad to be able to talk

I don’t see why you and Britta
aren’t together. Two cute white

Shirley, we’re not pandas in a zoo.
SHIRLEY
(seeing something)
Oh dear.
Jeff looks. Britta and Vaughn make out on the quad.
JEFF
That is not what I want to see.
Britta looks up, sees Jeff watching her.
SHIRLEY

Britta approaches Jeff at a table.
BRITTA
Heeeey.
JEFF
Hi, there. Want me to check you *
for grass stains?
BRITTA *
That was... embarrassing. *
JEFF
Oh, whatever. Seize the day, man, *
life is short. Get up on that. *
You know? All aboard the *
dreamboat. *
BRITTA
I wasn’t sure when or how to bring *
up that I was hanging out with
Vaughn. Figured you’d... make fun
of him. And me.
JEFF
First of all, friends don’t make
fun of each other, and secondly,
(mustering) *
Vaughn seems cool. *
Britta is impressed with Jeff. *
BRITTA *
You guys should hang out. Well, *
I gotta go. That was tacky out *
there, you’ll never see it again. *
JEFF
No worries.

11 EXT. QUAD - NEXT MORNING (DAY 3) 11
Pierce talks to Shirley as they exit the school building from
before. He wears his Ear-Noculars and Bluetooth.
PIERCE
This thing is amazing. I could
finally hear Mr. Chang from the
back of the room. Too bad they
don’t make one of these for
accents. What’s that? What do you *
mean you got a hold of some “sweet *
weed”? *
SHIRLEY
Doesn’t it get confusing with the *
phone in one ear and that thing in *
the other? *
PIERCE
It’s called living in the modern *
world. *
His cell phone RINGS in his other ear. It’s very loud for *
Pierce and startles him.
PIERCE (CONT’D)
Hello. Mom? Yes, I’ll visit soon. *
What do you mean, “Do I want a *
toke?” Wait. Who’s about to bust *
you? What pigs? What pigs are *
coming? Just put Dad on. *
As Pierce walks off contorting in confusion, Jeff hurries up *
to Shirley.
JEFF
Shirley! Did you notice Sr.
Chang’s socks today? Tiny bull
fighters.
SHIRLEY
I can top that. Did you see Hacky
Sack wears an anklet?
Jeff doesn’t react. *
SHIRLEY (CONT’D) *
Since when won’t you talk about *
Vaughn? No fun. *
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 14.
JEFF
I’m trying to be a good friend to *
Britta. She thought I’d make fun *
of him and I want to be *
unpredictable. I’m going to show *
her I’m not the jerk she thinks I *
am and friend the hell out of that *
green tea drinking drum circler. *
SHIRLEY
Okay, but tell me you’ve noticed
how small his nipples are.

Not engaging.
SHIRLEY

with bigger nips.
12 INT. EXPERIMENT ROOM/WAITING ROOM - LATER 12
The room is a complete mess, littered with take-out food
containers, crumpled pieces of paper and empty coffee cups.
Prof. Duncan, Annie and the other research assistants are
bleary eyed, but they continue to watch the monitor. On the
monitor, Abed happily sits in the same position.
PROF. DUNCAN
Is it on pause?
ANNIE
No, that’s just him.
Annie opens the door to the waiting room.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
Sorry you’ve been waiting...
(checks her watch, sighs)
twenty-six hours. It will be...
five more minutes.
ABED
Okie doke.
Annie closes the door and goes back to the experiment room.
Prof. Duncan tugs at his hair.
PROF. DUNCAN
Why won’t he leave?! *
RESEARCH ASSISTANT #1
Professor, I have other classes I
have to--
PROF. DUNCAN *
Go! Fine! I hate you. Go kill *
John Lennon again, you loser. *

YOU! This is all your fault! *
ANNIE
But you told me to bring subjects.
PROF. DUNCAN
Subjects! Not Rain Man! I should *
have never let you in this lab,
little Miss know-it-all, Annie
Fanny Panties in a bunch!
ANNIE
Oh, that’s sooo hilaaarious! Did
you think of that the last time you
skipped a trip to the dentist?
PROF. DUNCAN
Let me answer that question with
another question...
(makes raspberry noises)
Prof. Duncan starts yelling and stomping his feet in complete
exasperation. The other research assistants take notes on
his behavior. He notices.
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
What are you doing?! Stop writing!
He grabs one of their composition notebooks and throws it at *
them. Terrified, the assistants scramble to the door. *
PROF. DUNCAN (CONT’D)
Out! All of you! You’re all a *
bunch of dorks! *
(points at Annie) *
You destroyed the Duncan Principle! *

Prof. Duncan exits, slamming the door behind him. Annie, *
fuming, sits alone in the room. After a beat, she gets up
and opens the door to the waiting room where Abed is waiting
patiently.
ANNIE
Go home! *
She slams the door shut. WE STAY ON Abed, alone in the room.
ABED
Cool.
He gets up to go.
13 INT. CAFETERIA - LATER 13
Jeff sits with Britta and Vaughn.
JEFF
So Britta said you did a lot of
community service?
VAUGHN
Ultimate Frisbee at the Senior’s
Center. It’s amazing.
JEFF
And what makes frisbee ultimate?
VAUGHN
Aw, man, if I had a nickel for

me that. *

Britta is happy they are getting along.
BRITTA
I’m gonna get dessert. Want anything?
VAUGHN
Uh, carrots? *
JEFF
I’m good.
Britta exits. Shirley sees Jeff and Vaughn sitting together.
She makes eye contact with Jeff and gives him a shit-eating
grin and saunters over.
SHIRLEY
Hey, you two.
(to Vaughn)
Well that’s a cool shirt.
VAUGHN
Thanks.
Jeff looks at Shirley like “what are you up to?”
SHIRLEY
Where’s it from?
VAUGHN
Uh? Let me see.
He takes his shirt off. Shirley, behind Vaughn’s back,
smiles big at Jeff.
VAUGHN (CONT’D)
Hanes. Classic.
SHIRLEY
That’s nice.
Vaughn turns back to Jeff, still with his shirt off. While
Vaughn talks to Jeff about volunteering, Shirley motions for
Jeff to check out the nipples. So small. Where are they?
Jeff tries not to laugh.
VAUGHN
You know, people underestimate the
elderly, but you should see these
guys out there throwing the bee,
loving life. It’s inspiring.
JEFF
I’ll think about it.
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 18.

VAUGHN
No worries. Better check on Brits.
Vaughn exits. Shirley snickers while Jeff tries to suppress
a laugh.
JEFF
You are the devil.
Pierce and Troy walk up.
PIERCE *
Look what we’ve got here, Troy? A *
good old-fashioned clique.
JEFF
We’re not a clique.
PIERCE
I’m not naive. At Hawthorne Wipes,
my corporate board was torn asunder
by backstabbing and factionalism.
I’ve also seen “Mean Girls.”
(then)
So, what’s your plan? Pairing off
by twos? You, Shirley. Me, Troy.
TROY
I haven’t made a call on that yet.
PIERCE
We work so well as a group. Me,
Annie, Brittles, the Arab boy,... *
I just want you to think about that
before you throw it all away for a
sack of giggles.
Pierce strides off, letting his words sink in.

BRITTA
You like Vaughn, right? *
JEFF
He’s very cute. He’s got... *
shoulders. *
BRITTA
I’m worried that he’s thinking more
intensely about this thing than me.
He says stuff, you know, after...
JEFF
After... school?
BRITTA
(means sex)
After.
JEFF
(disgusted)
You had sex with him?
(forcing enthusiasm)
What was it like? *
BRITTA
What? Forget that. *
(flustered) *
The problem now is he’s calling me *
babe and trying to hold my hand,
it’s getting relationship-y. And *
he gave me, ugh, I can’t.
JEFF
What?
BRITTA
You can’t tell anyone about this.
Britta hands over a piece of paper. Jeff looks at it.
Remains stone faced.
JEFF
It’s a poem.
BRITTA
How do I respond to something like *
that? “Thank you”? *
Jeff holds gold.

JEFF *
That’s a difficult question. Which *
I will answer, - oh, someone’s *
texting me.
Jeff pulls his phone out. He holds it up in front of his
face, between it and the poem. He pretends to study and
operate the phone while adjusting the angle of the phone and
the paper.
JEFF (CONT’D) *
(pretending to read)
Just have to read this text, *

eye, Brit-ta.
SHIRLEY
(giggling)
Oh no, no, no. Wizard blue?
JEFF
Yes, yes, yes.
SHIRLEY
Oh, thank you. That has brightened
my day. I’m so glad we can rip on
that dude again.
JEFF
I’m trying to be a good friend to *
Britta, but I mean, the guy wrote a *
poem, right? Look. That’s the *
stain of a tear drop over the word,
“rad.”
Jeff and Shirley snicker. ANGLE ON Pierce, somewhere else on *
the quad, his Ear-Noculars pointed in Jeff and Shirley’s
direction. He clearly doesn’t like what he hears.
16 INT. STUDY ROOM - LATER 16
Abed and Troy are there. An exhausted Annie enters.
TROY
Hey, sorry for bailing on your
psych experiment yesterday.
ANNIE
(snapping)
That was the experiment, Troy. We
were testing how long people would
wait in the room.
This wrinkles Troy’s brain.
TROY
Whoa.

ABED
(understands; unphased)
Oh, gotcha.
ANNIE
“Gotcha”?! That’s all you have to
say? You sat in a room for twenty- *
six straight hours. No food, no
water. Didn’t that bother you?
ABED
(calm)
Yes. I was livid.
ANNIE
Then why didn’t you leave?!
ABED
Because you asked me to stay and
you said we were friends.
Annie doesn’t know what to say. She sits down, ashamed.
TROY
Aw, man...
(choking up)
That’s really beautiful.
(then)
Wait. Is this still part of the
experiment?
Jeff and Shirley enter, giggling and gabbing.
JEFF
...no, no. He’s more like a puppy
with a fish mouth.
SHIRLEY
Right, right, right. Like this...
Shirley does a Vaughn face. Jeff laughs. Pierce opens the
door to the study room and strides in.
PIERCE
That’s right. Laugh it up. You
guys want to know what they’re
doing right now? Making fun of all
of us. I heard you with my own
Ear... Noculars.

JEFF
Pierce, we--
PIERCE
Calling me “Hacky Sack,” ripping on
my six pack abs and my moist hair.
And apparently someone got a hold
of my poem. And that face she was
just making?...
(imitates Shirley’s “fish”
face)
That was obviously Annie.
TROY
Okay, this is definitely part of
the experiment.
SHIRLEY
Pierce, we weren’t making fun of you.
JEFF
We were talking about Britta’s
boyfriend, Vaughn.
PIERCE
(on a dime)
Oh, okay. Good.
(sits down; rubs hands
together)
But if we’re gonna do something,
let’s do it as a team. I’ll get
the ball rolling. Maybe he has a
tiny penis.
TROY
Who is this guy?
SHIRLEY
Oh, you all have to see him.
Everything’s, “no worries, no
worries.” And he always has to say
three greetings in a row. And show
them the poem.
Shirley takes Vaughn’s poem print out from Jeff and hands it *
over.
JEFF
Oh, maybe don’t show that. I don’t
think we should--
BRITTA (O.S.)
I should be done in an hour.

VAUGHN
No worries.
TROY
He just said it!
BRITTA
Hey guys, you’ve met Vaughn, right?
VAUGHN
Hey. What’s up. Hi.
Shirley holds up three fingers. The group tries not to laugh
but can’t hold it in.
PIERCE
(whispering too loud)
He’s a fool.
VAUGHN
Whoa, this group’s got a case of
the giggles. Tight.
Vaughn sits down at the table, moving the bag out of his way.
His poem is revealed.
VAUGHN (CONT’D)
Is that?
(to Britta)
You showed them my poem? *
BRITTA
No.
PIERCE

I can’t believe I showed you that

SHIRLEY *

Can we talk?
Jeff sighs and sits with Shirley.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Jeff. I have a gossip problem.
JEFF
I’m not a real supporter of this
word but... duh.
SHIRLEY
I stir the pot, Jeff. I’m a pot *
stirrer. This isn’t the only study
group I’ve had this year. See
those ladies over there?
ANGLE ON a group of African American women hanging out
together. One of them gives Shirley a dirty look.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
I was in that group until they
kicked me out. They call me
“Tattle-ina.”

It’s a bumblebee nickname. It’s
cute but it stings.
Jeff looks over at Shirley’s former study group.
"Community" - #104 - "Social Psychology" - Pink Revised - 8/24/09 26.

Look how big that woman’s earrings

her)
This is never going to work. It’s *

Shirley smiles. Jeff starts off.
SHIRLEY

DUNCAN
Oh Annie, there you are. You know, *
after I went home and drank and *
slept and drank some more, I
realized it was I who had reached a *

No student in any department has

Annie turns and gives everyone an enthusiastic wave.
ANNIE
Tonight, in the library, I will be
hosting a Dia de Los Muertos party.
Dia de Los Muertos, or Day of the
Dead, is sometimes referred to as
Mexican Halloween, --
CHANG
A name quite offensive to people
familiar with “Mexican Halloween”
as a sexual position. At any rate,
if you show up, you get extra
credit. Me, I don’t even get paid.
See you tonight.
Chang shuffles out. People start to leave.
ANNIE
Um, most of you have responded to
my E-vite, but some of you
remain... E-Vasive, so...

Oh, hey. Awkward. How small is
this campus?
Shirley watches Jeff pursue Professor Slater down the hall.
SHIRLEY
Bastard.
BRITTA
It’s fine, I don’t care. *
SHIRLEY
It’s disgusting the way men behave. *
Did you see the Katherine Heigl *
movie poster where Gerard Butler *
has a heart over his wiener? That *
resonated with me. *
BRITTA
Yeah, but just to repeat, I don’t *
care what Jeff does. *

Jeff walks with Slater.
JEFF
I’m barely a student. I’m older
than you. I own a Lexus. I saw *
Ghostbusters in the theatre. Look, *
my gums are receding.
PROFESSOR SLATER
It’s uncanny how many of my buttons *
you’re finding. But I have a *
personal rule about this and I *
stick to it. *
JEFF
Have a cup of coffee with me. I *
bet I can change your mind.
PROFESSOR SLATER
Oh, I know you can. That’s why *
you’re not getting the chance.
She smiles and exits. Jeff watches her walk away. He turns, *
smiling, and is suddenly face to face with Annie. *
ANNIE *
Are you coming to my Dias de los
Muertos party?
JEFF
I’m definitely going to try to
swing by.
Jeff starts off. She follows. *
ANNIE
Then I can mark you down as *
definitely being there from seven *
sharp ‘til upside down Spanish *
question mark? *
JEFF
Here’s the thing-- *
ANNIE
(controlled anger) *
No. Here’s the thing. I am *
putting my foot down. Do you *
understand? *

Annie, you have such a bright *

ANNIE *
Jeff, you’re the cool guy, okay? *
If you show up, it’ll be the first *
party I host where everyone doesn’t *
say they need to get home in time *
for the news. *
Annie starts to cry. *
JEFF *
That won’t work. Last time you did *
this, I kept a vial of your tears *
and have been slowly building an *
immunity. *
ANNIE *
(blubbering) *
I was so unpopular in high school *
the crossing guard used to lure me *
into traffic! This party is a *
second chance at a fresh start. *
Jeff is covering his eyes, already knowing he’s lost. *
JEFF
I’m coming to your party. *
ANNIE *
(sniffle) *
Thank you. I’m putting you down *
for two bags of ice and a sleeve of *
paper cups. *

“Friday” pills.

Annie’s party is in full swing. It’s decked out with various
symbols of death: coffins, wreaths, skeletons on stilts.
Creepy Mardi Gras-esque music plays. Troy is dressed as
Eddie Murphy in the “Raw” concert movie. Sr. Chang is a
mariachi. Britta is a squirrel. Jeff is not in costume.
Annie glides over to Britta wearing a long black robe and a
skull mask, which she now lifts onto her head like a hat.
ANNIE
Britta, you’re adorable!

ANNIE (CONT’D)
Okay, I think we can begin! I’ve *
got everyone’s personalized cookie *
tombstones... *

She hands out cookie tombstones with each person’s name. *
ANNIE (CONT’D)
And, in a few minutes we’re going
to start the Dance of the Dead...

La Danza de los Muertos...
SR. CHANG
You don’t have to keep doing that.
Britta comes up to Jeff. *
BRITTA *
It’s really nice of you to be here. *
I’m sure you’d rather be out with *
your hot professor. *
JEFF *
Well, it’s funny: I enrolled here *
as a selfish loner, but you and the *
group have given me a crash course *
in friendship. *

Pierce stops and stares confidently, arms akimbo.
BRITTA
Who are you?
PIERCE
I’m the Beastmaster. From the

have you been living under?
(re: Jeff’s non-costume)
What are you going as? A gay
douchebag? I’m kidding.
JEFF
Good one. I’m not much of a *
costume guy.
PIERCE
You’re not much of a “liking

am on fire. *
Pierce moves off. ANGLE ON Shirley approaching Jeff and
Britta carrying drinks. She wears thick glasses, a scarf and

Lights. Music. *
Abed is standing by a laptop, working the music. *

Hey, guy, what did you slip me? *
I’m grinding my teeth and I want to *
kiss everybody. *
STAR-BURNS *
What did you slip me? My heart *
stopped racing and I can’t pee! *
ANGLE ON: ANNIE. The students have formed a circle. *

The faculty party is markedly adult with a string trio,
caterers and a bar with bartenders. DEAN PELTON hosts in a
tuxedo and masquerade ball mask. Professor Slater, dressed
as a racy Robin Hood, struggles to get a top off a beer. A
hand reaches into frame and grabs the beer. Tight on a
cowboy boot as the top is popped off using a spur. WIDEN to
reveal Jeff decked out in a sexy, tailored cowboy outfit with
hat, lasso, holster and six-shooters.
JEFF
There you go, pretty lady.
PROFESSOR SLATER
What are you doing here? *
JEFF *
Showing you my non-student side. *
PROFESSOR SLATER *
I have to admit, this outfit is *
doing it for me. I may or may not *
have been deflowered by a junior
rodeo champion.
JEFF *
You’re reminding me of my first
time as well.
PROFESSOR SLATER
You lost your virginity to Robin *
Hood? *
JEFF
No, to an attractive woman at a *
party. We seem destined to repeat *
history. *
PROFESSOR SLATER *
I told you, no students. It’s *
unseemly. I go out with you, you *

Whoa. Yippy ki yay. Thought you *
weren’t a costume guy. *

Yeah? Did you stop by a costume *
store? Because I don’t think any *
would be open this late. *
JEFF

BRITTA
I think the words you’re looking

“yes.”
Professor Slater joins the conversation. *

That’s right, Professor Slim *
Calves! This is what you get when *
you steal Jeff from a good woman! *
ANGLE on everyone in STUNNED SILENCE. Slater STARES at Jeff. *
SUDDENLY Pierce GROOVES IN. He dances to the center of the *
room, gyrating to music only he hears, stroking people’s
hair, grinding his teeth, rubbing his head. Everyone’s

SHIRLEY *
My ex-husband came by this morning. *
He asked for his ring back. It was *
his mother’s and he wants to give *
it to his new girlfriend. *
BRITTA *
I’m sorry. That sucks. *
Britta sits next to her. *
SHIRLEY *
Don’t get me wrong, the best thing *
that ever happened to me was him *
leaving. But I always thought he’d *
come crawling back, and I’d get to *
tell him to go to hell. But he *
couldn’t even give me that. I’m so *
angry. And I know this seems crazy *
to be destroying some hot young *
professor’s office, but... it makes *
me feel better. *

You’re right, though. We should *
go. *
Shirley starts out. Britta stops her. *
BRITTA *
Wait a minute. Let’s finish this *
thing. *

1 INT. STUDY ROOM - MORNING (DAY 1) 1
JEFF, BRITTA, SHIRLEY, ANNIE and PIERCE hang out. Pierce is
telling the world’s longest joke. Annie wears a sweatshirt
that reads, “Greendale Debate.”
PIERCE
...So then the guy says to the
housekeeper, “make sure she’s
dead.” Stop me if you’ve heard
this one.
JEFF
It would’ve been nice to have that
option twenty-seven minutes ago.
PIERCE
Anyway the housekeeper says, “we
don’t have a pool.”
(chuckles)
And the guy says...
DEAN PELTON (O.S.)
Good morning, Greendale! A few
quick announcements. The world
class Greendale debate team...
ANNIE
We are kind of kicking butt these
days.
DEAN PELTON (O.S.)
Will bring home the championship
tomorrow versus City College. On *
that there is no debate.
PIERCE
So the housekeeper says to the guy,
“we don’t have a pool,”
(chuckles again)
and the guy says...
DEAN PELTON (O.S.)
To be clear, “there is no debate”
is just a figure of speech. There
is actually a debate at eight P.M..
Go Human Beings!
PIERCE
Now I’ve got to start the whole
joke over. So there’s this guy on
a business trip...
BRITTA
No! I got one. A doddering old
fool walks into a bar, tells a
stupid joke, and I crush his
windpipe with my three ringed
binder.
The group sits in stunned silence.
SHIRLEY
(courtesy laugh, then)
I don’t get it.
JEFF
Britta’s trying to give up
cigarettes.
BRITTA
Don’t tell them my business. I’ll
smack that smug look right off your
pointy face.
JEFF
Okay, Britta, I’m saying this
because I’m your friend and because
I care about you. You need to
start smoking again.
ANNIE/PIERCE/SHIRLEY
He’s right. / You should. / It’s
really not that bad for you.
BRITTA
I appreciate your support, but I’ve
got to quit this time.
PIERCE
Have you tried hypnotherapy? I
know a dynamite hypnotherapist.
JEFF
Ten-to-one says it’s him.

Abed less inclined towards
terrorism. Jeff I could make you

JEFF
Can you help me block out people’s
voices I find extremely annoying?
PIERCE
(re: Britta)
Jeff, she’s right here.
BRITTA
Pierce, I would be grateful for
your help.
PIERCE
Really? Super. We’ll set it up.
Jeff pulls Britta aside and looks at her like she’s crazy.
BRITTA
What? I’m going to quit smoking
anyway. This way at least Pierce
can feel good about himself.
JEFF
And he would deserve that... why?
BRITTA
I feel sorry for him. He wants to
feel important so badly. Plus I
just yelled at him.
JEFF
You yelled at me too.
BRITTA
(baby talk)
Ohhh. Did I hurt your feelings
pointy face?
Troy enters with a lap top. He turns to Jeff. *

to the scene in episode 107 where the group confronts Jeff
about sleeping in his car.
BRITTA
Those people look just like us.
It’s eerie.
SHIRLEY
Ooh. My character’s got it going

BRITTA

Britta and Pierce approach a sound proof music room.
PIERCE
I reserved the music room for our
session.
They open the door. SR. CHANG is there jamming on a guitar.
He’s awesome, lost in a rock star fantasy. He notices them
and stops.
BRITTA
Wow. You’re amazing.
SR. CHANG
Thanks for the validation. Now my
life is complete.
He exits.
BRITTA
I really appreciate you helping me
out, Pierce.
PIERCE
And I appreciate the opportunity.
Sometimes I feel like people don’t
take me seriously.
Pierce references a hypnosis manual. He steps behind Britta
and reaches into his backpack.
BRITTA
(playful)
So what are you going to do? Wave
a pocket watch in front of my face

Britta surreptitiously opens one eye but is stuck pretending

The Group is filing in. Annie is mid-conversation with Jeff.
ANNIE
The topic for the debate is, “Are
people inherently good or evil?”
So when are we getting together to
strategize?

I think I can handle it.

“Jeff” kicking a vending machine and freaking out.
ABED (CONT’D)
Jeff’s character acts like nothing
around here affects him, but things
bother him more than he lets on.
He’s also very vain.
JEFF
Pfft. Ridiculous.
Jeff puts his foot on the table revealing his plaid socks
match his plaid button down. ON FILM we see Troy crying.
TROY

Why am I crying? Will I
accidentally listen to “Come Sail

You don’t have to worry, Troy.

She hits the podium with her fist a little late. She leaves
to a smattering of applause. The judges write notes.
DEAN PELTON
And now, for City College, Jeremy
Simmons.
City College students erupt with applause as SIMMONS emerges
in a motorized wheel chair. He sports a pony tail and
hipster facial hair. As the crowd chants, “Simmons!
Simmons!” he pumps one fist in the air, blows kisses to the
crowd, and shoots Annie a very seductive wink.

said anything.
Jean melts again. She writes something.

work for anything.
JEFF
Hey! I’ve worked hard my whole
life to not have to work at things.
ANNIE
Well you’re knee deep in it now,
brother, this is debate. You want
to win you need to prepare.
JEFF
Well if you want to win you need
to...
(mimics her stiff hand
gesture from debate)
Loosen up. Go off book. *
He mimics her stiff punching the table gesture.
ANNIE
You’re right. Look at me. My hair
is pulled back like a spinster
librarian, I dress like a
housewife.
Annie undoes her hair and takes off her sweater. She looks
great.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
That feels better. I’m so tense.
She stretches out her back in an unintentionally seductive
fashion. Jeff notices. Shirley pops her head in, laughing.
SHIRLEY
Be careful. Abed thinks you two
are going to kiss. Ridiculous.
Shirley exits, laughing. Jeff and Annie stare at each other.

ANNIE (CONT'D)
JEFF
Us kissing. That is ridiculous.
ANNIE
Totally. Let’s get back to work.
JEFF
Okay. People are inherently evil.
ANNIE
Ooh, we can use this Hobbes quote.
She moves to Jeff to show him. She leans over him, he turns
to look at her paper and can’t help staring at her cleavage.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
(reading)
“Man is a collection of base,
animal urges. To act on them and
experience sinful pleasures would
be morally no different than taking
a breath.” That’s poignant right?
JEFF
(voice cracking)
Yes.
(then)
You know, I’m starting to feel
tense.
He stretches his arms over his head revealing his six-pack.
Annie notices. A sexually tense beat.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Maybe it’d be better if we prepared
on our own.
ANNIE
Yes. That way we can be more
reproductive... productive.
JEFF
See you, buddy.
ANNIE
See you, pal.
She goes in for a hug, he goes for a handshake. He switches
to a hug as she switches to a handshake. Finally, he pats
her on top of her head and she leaves.

Pierce is with Britta. She’s “mid-hypnosis.” Pierce paces
with his leg brace, still referring to his manual.
PIERCE
...The next time you see a *
cigarette you will think of things

All the ladies in the house say, *
“Oh yeah!” *
BRITTA *

Oh yeah. *
Pierce struts around the room feeling good about himself, *
then notices Britta’s reflection in the bell of a tuba. She *
OPENS HER EYES and mouths “What the fuck?” Pierce reacts, *
surprised and hurt and gets an idea. *
PIERCE *
While you’re under so deep, you’ll *
also find yourself attracted to *
slightly older men? Perhaps a *
barrel chested stud with just *
enough tummy to love. You’ll want *
to buy him dinner. Then go back to *
his hot tub. Maybe you’ll have *
some sort of fixation with *
massaging his buns. *
Britta struggles not to react. *

some kind of joke to you? *
BRITTA *
No. I was trying to make you feel *
better about yourself.
PIERCE *
Why? *
BRITTA
(caught) *
You know, because people don’t *
always take you as seriously as-- *
PIERCE
How dare you pity me. You know, I *
may be a little older, some of my *
ideas may seem weird, my fashion *

Everyone is there for the debate. Simmons is at the podium.
Jeff sits with Annie looking serious this time. He sports a
Greendale Debate sweatshirt.

SIMMONS
...As German poet Franz Wickmeyer
wrote, “Snow falls from the heavens
pure. We can not blame the snow
for being soiled by the Earth.”
Ergo, the world may be bad, but
man, is inherently good.
City College applauds. Dean Pelton, Annie and the Human
Being wince.
PROF. WHITMAN *
Now Jeff Winger will offer a two *
minute rebuttal.
DEAN PELTON *
(sotto) *
It’s all on the line, Winger.
(re: sweatshirt, sincere)
Thanks for suiting up.
Jeff gives Annie a thumbs up. He’s ready. He walks to the
podium. Simmons turns to his giant, chubby SAMOAN partner.
SIMMONS
Who’s the “fifth Beach Boy” gonna
hit on now? What a joker.
The Samoan nods.
JEFF
In the Stanford Prison Experiment
twenty-one out of twenty-one
students, when given absolute
power, abused and tortured their
fellow students... *
Whitman reacts, impressed. Annie leans towards him. *
ANNIE *
Jeff prepared. Grab an umbrella. *
It’s gonna rain City College blood. *
JEFF *
...Genocide has taken place in *
every century throughout recorded
history. My competitor likened
people to pure falling snow. I
would respond, “It is written,
there is none righteous, no, not
one.” Now, I realize Mister
Simmon’s quote was from the great

Oh God, did I just say crossburner?
SHIRLEY
No you did not.
PIERCE
Oh good.

Let’s go Klan!
(corrects on a dime)
Team!
Simmons is at the podium.
SIMMONS
Webster’s Dictionary defines
inherent as “existing in someone or
something as a permanent and
inseparable quality.” Permanent.

So for one to be “inherently evil”
one would need to be born that way.
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you
this...
Simmons reaches behind the podium and holds up an adorable
BABY.
SIMMONS (CONT’D)
(re: baby)
Is he evil?
The City College side erupts. Simmons points to a teen
mother in a City College sweatshirt. She gives him a “way to
go” fist pump. Troy starts to applaud.
TROY
(off looks)
I’m sorry, that dude’s awesome.
ANGLE ON Simmons basking in his moment. ANGLE ON Britta
watching disappointed from underneath the bleachers.
BRITTA
Those guys are screwed.
She takes out a cigarette, then stops herself, staring at it
quizzically. ANGLE ON Whitman, the Dean and Annie *
devastated. Jeff confidently strides up to Simmons.
JEFF
(re: baby)
May I?
Jeff takes the baby, holds him up to eye level. The baby
slaps Jeff in the face as the crowd reacts amazed.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Actions speak louder than words. *
The crowd breaks into applause. They start chanting “Winger,
Winger, Winger.” He’s done it. He basks.
ANNIE
That was brilliant. How did you
know it would do that?
JEFF
Babies hate me. They can sense I
don’t care.
Whitman and the Dean are elated. *

he can win in rebuttal.
PROF. WHITMAN *
Simmons is finished. *
Simmons is at the podium. He takes in the crowd, then
dramatically tosses his notes in the air as he motors
towards Annie and Jeff. The notes waft stylistically behind
him. The crowd ripples with anticipation.
ANNIE/CROWD/JUDGES
He’s abandoning his notes. / He’s *
going rogue. / It’s a gambit. *
Simmons gets closer to Jeff. JEFF’S POV. Simmons is about
to reach him, pulls the levers on two wheel breaks and
launches himself into the air SLO MO towards him. Jeff
instinctively catches him. A silent, stunned beat.
SIMMONS
(from Jeff’s arms)
People are inherently good.
The City College side goes nuts. Jeff is at a loss. Suddenly,
Annie grabs Jeff’s head and makes out with him. The crowd
reacts. Shirley reacts; “Abed was right.” Jeff submits to
the kiss, reaches to hug Annie while tossing a limp Simmons
to the floor. Simmons lands with a thud. Annie breaks the
kiss and turns to the crowd indicating Jeff and Simmons.
ANNIE
People are inherently evil!
The crowd goes BONKERS. It’s pandemonium.
JEAN
Greendale wins!
PROF. WHITMAN *
Huzzah! *
Simmons deflates. The Samoan starts to weep. The judges
hand the Dean a tiny trophy. He hoists it in the air.

That’s not happening.
ABED
No it’s not. And neither is the

1 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT 1
A door swings open to reveal a smiling TROY and a creepily
oversmiling ABED in matching blazers and ascots. TASTEFUL
JAZZ plays inside.
TROY / ABED
(to morning show theme)
Troy and Abed’s new aparrr-tment!
ANNIE and BRITTA stand in the hall, holding gifts.
ANNIE / BRITTA
Hiiiiii

iiiiiiiiii.
2 INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS 2
Annie and Britta enter, ad libbing “What a cute place!”
There are framed photos of Troy and Abed on the wall.
BRITTA
Wow, you guys look so fancy.
ABED
We read a book on how to be the
perfect party hosts. Rule Number
One: dress to impress.
TROY
Rule Number Two: avoid touchy
topics like “The Negro Problem.”
(then)
The book was written in the ‘40s.
SHIRLEY pokes her head out of the kitchen.
SHIRLEY
Oh good, you guys are finally here!
BRITTA
Finally?
ABED
Shirley showed up at three.
Abed, Annie, Britta, and Troy share a knowing look.
(CONTINUED)
SHIRLEY
Time flies when I’m baking!
TROY
(clenched teeth)
No, it doesn’t.
ANNIE
Oh! The door downstairs was
propped open with this.
She holds up a brick.
ANNIE (CONT’D)
This is really unsafe. Anyone
could have just wandered into your
building. A thief, or a vagrant,
or a guy who writes things on
strips of greasy newspaper and
slides them under your door while
you’re at school.
(off their looks)
Or a solicitor.
An INTERCOM BUZZER goes off.
ABED
Or the rest of our guests.
TROY
(takes brick)
Be right back.
Troy hurries off. Abed leads Britta and Annie down the hall.
ABED
Let me give you ladies the grand
tour. Bathroom, kitchen, who
cares, and this:
(gestures)
Is my scale model of the rolling
boulder scene from “Raiders.” With
actual rolling boulder.
Abed activates the diorama. A model boulder rolls down a
ramp and into his hand.
ABED (CONT’D)
Pretty cool, huh.
BRITTA
Super cool. And sexy. Super sexy
cool.

Overselling it.
Shirley approaches with a homemade pizza on a tray.
SHIRLEY
I made pizza!
ABED
But... we ordered real pizza.
SHIRLEY
Nothing more real than homemade.
You didn’t have some of the
ingredients, so I used ketchup and
cream cheese.
ABED
(glaring)
We ordered... real... pizza.
Everyone gets uncomfortable. Shirley backs away to the
kitchen. Troy enters with JEFF and PIERCE, who holds a gift.
TROY
Bienvenido de la casa Chez Tro-Bed.
Jeff looks at the Indiana Jones diorama.
JEFF
Very nice. “Indiana Jones and The
Apartment of Perpetual Virginity.”
TROY
(laughs, a little hurt)
Chop busted, my fellow adult!
PIERCE
(looks around)
It’s nice. I mean, it’s not
mansion nice, but it’s nice. Hey,
didn’t you used to live in a
mansion, with me?
TROY
Yeah, but this place is a little
more my speed. And century.
PIERCE
Doesn’t bother me. I’ve hardly
missed you at all since I had you
removed from my portraits.

Banned in Serbia, Jeff. Let that
concept sink in.
JEFF
You enjoy, I’ll be leaving early.
ABED
Oh?
JEFF
Yeah, sorry, I got an invite to the
opening of a new club,
(produces 3 x 5 card)
Look at this place, it’s like it
was designed for me.
ABED
It was. I made that in photoshop
and mailed it to you a month ago so
you’d keep tonight open on your
calendar.
JEFF
(re: invite, mournful)
There’s no such thing as the
“Single Malt Platinum Boobs and
Billiards Club?”
(realizing it’s dumb)
I guess I never said it out loud.
ABED
Tonight, we offer something far
more than boobs and billiards.
JEFF
What.
TROY
One word, two syllables...
JEFF
Don’t say “charades.”
Abed and Troy gesture to a table set up for:
ABED / TROY
Yahtzee!

ACT ONE
FADE IN:
3 INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 3
Britta is fiddling with an iPod that’s connected to a stereo
behind her. No music is playing. Troy shakes a dice cup.
TROY
Commmme onnnnn, and...
Troy slams down the cup, lifts it up and looks at the dice.
TROY (CONT’D)
Okay. Now:
(reads instructions)
“How to play Yahtzee...”
PIERCE
(takes game box)
Is there nothing from our youth
these companies won’t repackage for
a buck? Call it “Yahtzee” all you
want, everyone knows this is Puerto
Rican chess.
The door BUZZER sounds. Annie jumps with a start.
JEFF
It’s just the pizza, Annie.
ABED
We can’t buzz him up. Someone has
to go down.
A beat, then everyone touches the side of their noses. Sevenway tie. The BUZZER again. Jeff picks up a die.
JEFF
Okay. Starting on my left with
one, your number comes up, you go.
People ad lib agreement. Jeff shakes the die in his hand.
ABED
Just so you know, Jeff, you are now
creating six different timelines.
JEFF
(sarcastic)
Of course I am, Abed.

As Britta finds a song, Jeff rolls the die. Two.
JEFF (CONT’D)
(counting from his left)
One two. Annie.
Britta hits play. The Police’s “Roxanne” begins.
ANNIE
Okay, fine. Guess I’m going down.
She gets her wallet out, sets her purse down on the table in
front of her seat, and exits.
PIERCE
All this talk of “going down”
reminds me: did you guys know I had
sex with Eartha Kitt in an airplane
bathroom?
Everyone winces and groans.
PIERCE (CONT’D)
What? It’s not name dropping if it
comes up organically!
SHIRLEY
I’m gonna check on my pies.
Shirley heads into the kitchen. Just as Sting sings the
opening lyric:
BRITTA
(belts out)
Rooxxx--
JEFF
(cutting her off)
No.
Britta stops and turns off the music, annoyed at Jeff.
BRITTA
Bathroom?
ABED
Over here.
Britta gets up and follows Abed. Troy watches her go. His
eyes shift down to Annie’s open purse on the table.

TROY
Uh, guys... What does a pregnancy
test look like?
JEFF
It’s like a thin plastic stick with
a thing at the end.
TROY
So this is definitely a gun.
Troy uses a pencil to lift a gun from Annie’s purse.
JEFF
Whoa! Put that down.
TROY
(lowers gun into purse)
Why does Annie have a gun?
PIERCE
That’s not a gun, it’s a girls’ pea
shooter, I’ve had raw fish more
dangerous than that.
(giving gift)
Here, Troy. Happy housewarming.
TROY
(ignoring Pierce)
Jeff, what are we doing about this?
JEFF
I’m getting a drink.
Jeff stands, smacking his head on the ceiling fan. Pierce
laughs.
JEFF (CONT’D)
Owwww! What’s so funny?
PIERCE
People hitting their heads!
Shirley enters from the kitchen with a tray of mini pies.
SHIRLEY
Don’t fight over them!

Britta exits the bathroom, startled to find Abed right there,
staring expectantly at her. She waits.
ABED
Smells weird.
BRITTA
I beg your pardon?
ABED
Smells weird. What did you do?
BRITTA
Abed, as a psych major, I
understand you might not understand
this, but you don’t ask someone a
question like that. It’s not
dignified.
Annie enters the apartment with the pizzas.
BRITTA (CONT’D)
(ravenous)
Pizza!
(does a little dance)
Pizza pizza go in tummy. Me so
hung-ee, me so hung-ee.
Britta and Abed follow Annie with the pizzas, walking right
past Shirley, who tries, in vain, to offer them pies.
5 INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 5
Annie sets the pizzas down. Britta dives in. Others join.
ANNIE
That pizza guy was intense.
JEFF
I’m sure he’s a real go-getter.
ABED

I wonder what happened in all those
other timelines.
JEFF
Abed, there are no other timelines.
BUZZ!

6 INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES EARLIER 6
The pizza is gone - or rather not here yet. Everyone has
fingers on noses, as before. Jeff picks up a die.
JEFF
Okay. Starting on my left with
one, your number comes up, you go.
People ad lib agreement. Jeff shakes the die in his hand.
ABED
Just so you know, Jeff, you are now
creating six different timelines.
JEFF
Of course I am, Abed.
Jeff rolls the die. Four.
JEFF (CONT’D)
One two three four. Shirley.
Britta hits play. The Police’s “Roxanne” begins.
SHIRLEY
Okay, but don’t let my pies burn!
Shirley gets up and exits.
JEFF
Remember: nobody eats those pies.
ANNIE
Come on. Let’s just talk to her.
JEFF
We tried that, Annie, she ignored
us. The woman has a baking
problem. Now, I don’t like being
the bad guy any more than--

ABED

Britta gets up and follows Abed. Troy watches her go.
JEFF
(continuing)
We have a pact. Do not enable
Shirley’s baking. It’s better for
her in the long run.
PIERCE
You know who got it in the long
run? Eartha Kitt. When I nailed
her in an airplane bathroom.
(off groans)
What? It came up organically.
(then)
Here, Troy. Happy housewarming.
Pierce hands his gift, which sits in his lap, to Troy.
TROY
Oh, cool, thanks, Pierce.
Troy opens the gift to reveal a creepy looking troll
figurine. Troy shrieks and jumps up in horror.
JEFF
What’s that?
PIERCE
(loving it)
It’s a traditional Norwegian troll.
When Troy and I lived together, I
had it on display in the hall
outside his bedroom. Troy always
seemed so... taken with it.
Jeff chuckles.
TROY
What’s so funny?
JEFF
People that are scared of dolls!
TROY
It used to watch me in my sleep!

Jeff stands up and smacks his head on the ceiling fan.
Pierce laughs at him. Jeff buries the pain for Annie.
ANNIE
Oh my God are you okay?
JEFF
Barely felt it.
ANNIE
Let me look at it in the bathroom.
As she leads him across the living room...

8 INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 8
Britta and Abed follow Shirley to the table, where Annie and
Jeff intersect with them.
SHIRLEY

Did someone get my pies out?
Annie gasps. The others exchange guilty looks.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Seriously?
Shirley storms into the kitchen.

SHIRLEY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Seriously?!
Shirley emerges from the kitchen with burnt pies on a tray.
SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
I ask one thing. One thing.
She drops the tray on the table.
JEFF
Shirley, it doesn’t matter, we
weren’t going to eat them, you’re
not allowed to have “baking things”
as an identity!
SHIRLEY
Excuse me for being the only
married woman in a group of horny
toads that sit around all night
making googly eyes at each other!
JEFF / ANNIE
(covering)
Googly eyes?
The two exchange an awkward look. Jeff turns to Britta, who
rolls her eyes and turns to Troy, who quickly pretends that
he wasn’t staring at her. Troy turns to Abed, who gives him
“sexy eyebrows.” Troy looks away and directly into the eyes
of Torg the troll, which Pierce is holding up. Troy screams.
PIERCE
(trying to console her)
Hey, Shirley, nobody makes googly
eyes at me either. We’re the same.
That’s the last straw for Shirley. She cries, stomps past
them over their protests, and out the door, slamming it
behind her. The slamming door causes the Raiders diorama’s
boulder to roll loose. Abed has to race over to stop it.
ABED
(eating pizza)
I don’t know what she’s so upset
about. Her pies probably didn’t
burn on the other timelines.
JEFF
Abed, Shirley just had a nervous
breakdown --

PIERCE
Crap.

Speaking of crap, did I ever tell
you about the time Eartha Kitt
decided to bang me in an airplane
bathroom?

What? It’s where my mind went.
Pierce exits.
JEFF
Your mind went years ago.
Annie titters. She and Jeff share a flirtatious look.
SHIRLEY

I’m gonna check on my pies.
Shirley gets up and heads into the kitchen, just as Sting

No.
Britta stops, annoyed at Jeff. She turns off the music.
BRITTA

ANNIE
I love your place, Troy. You’re

JEFF
Yeah, can you believe those are
real mahogany bunk beds? Bet those
cost you a few allowances.
Annie looks where Jeff is looking. There are indeed bunk
beds in one of the rooms. They start laughing. Troy,
miffed, gets up from the table.
ANNIE
Troy! Aww.
JEFF
Now we done it.
11 INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS 11
Troy storms past Abed, knocking the Indiana Jones model.
ABED

Troy doesn’t listen. Abed catches the boulder on the model.
He fiddles with it, trying to reset it.
12 INT. BATHROOM - SAME 12
Britta is hunched against an open window when she hears a
knock on the door. It startles her. She exhales a plume of
smoke out the window.
BRITTA
Who is it?
TROY (O.S.)
Troy.
BRITTA
I’m washing my hands!
TROY (O.S.)
Good, then I can come in.

Troy pulls out a silver cigarette case from his blazer, flips
it open and takes out a cigarette. Britta, surprised and
pleased, offers him a light from her lighter. He waves her
off as he starts chewing the candy cigarette into his mouth.
BRITTA
I know. We all know that.
TROY
Then why is Jeff always picking on
me?
A13 INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME A13
Annie and Jeff are alone at the table.
ANNIE
You seem to be a little hard on
Troy lately.

Troy and Britta sit on the corner of the tub, both eating
candy cigarettes. They’ve been bonding.
BRITTA
He’s butting antlers with you
because you’re a threat, now.
You've got your own place, you’ve
got a future, you’ve got a bowl of
olives next to the toilet...
TROY
It’s a fancy party, Britta.
BRITTA
You know what Jeff has in his
bathroom? Neither do I. He keeps
his toiletries in a safe under the
sink. His whole personality is
based on guarding himself. You
don’t need to be like that to be a
man.

Jeff, Annie, and Shirley exit from the kitchen, Jeff with a

Ceiling fan.
PIERCE
I miss all the fun.
Troy and Britta enter. As they eat pizza, it’s clear - to

Britta gets up and heads for the door. Troy watches her go.
PIERCE

Lot of stories on airplanes. I

Shirley gets up and heads for the kitchen. Troy, Abed,
Pierce, Annie and Jeff sit together for a moment.

TROY
You’re the best.
ABED
Want to stay up all night talking

Annie is tending to Jeff’s head.

Until they suddenly hear Troy SCREAM O.S.
19 INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 19
Troy is freaking, jumping up and down. Pierce is holding the
creepy troll figurine out toward him, making scary noises.
PIERCE
Feel the terror, Troy! Feel the
terror of the Norwegian troll!
Jeff and Annie enter from one side, Shirley from another.
SHIRLEY
What is going on in here?
ABED
Pierce is terrorizing Troy because
he’s jealous we moved in together.
PIERCE
You’re the one who’s jealous.
ABED
Why would I be jealous?
PIERCE
(snapping)
Because you’re lonely and crazy!
Everyone gets quiet. Pierce composes himself, embarrassed.
BRITTA (O.S.)
Hey, guys.
Everyone looks to see Britta, holding the pizzas, standing
next to a SKEEZY PIZZA DELIVERY GUY.
BRITTA (CONT’D)

Troy gets up and sprints into the hall.

Troy races out the door, SLAMMING it behind him. The

The boulder breaks loose and rolls down the diorama, crushing
the Indiana Jones figurine before rolling onto the floor. It
rolls down the hall as Sting sings the opening lyric:

She grabs her purse and moves toward Jeff, and she steps on
the rolling boulder, slips, and flies up, and the purse flies
out of her hand. Pierce jumps up out of his seat with his
gift. Annie lands on the coffee table, propelling everything
on it into the air, including Pierce’s bottle of rum.
The bottle smashes to the floor, coating it with rum.
Annie’s purse lands hard on the floor -- BANG! Her gun goes
off, shooting Pierce in the leg!
PIERCE
AAAAAGH!
Pierce’s leg SPURTS BLOOD, and he falls to the ground, which
sends his gift tumbling across the floor.
JEFF
What the hell?!
Abed hurries from the hall and stares at the chaos.
Shirley runs out of the kitchen in time to get a face full of
spraying blood. She screams in horror!
Annie rushes to Pierce and puts pressure on his wound.
ANNIE
(to Jeff)
Call 9-1-1! Abed, help me stop the
bleeding!
Jeff scrambles for his phone, and Abed rushes to help Annie.
PIERCE
I’m dying! I’m dying!
Britta stumbles out from the bathroom, lit joint in her
mouth. Shocked, she opens her mouth, dropping the joint, and
it lands in the spilled rum and -- WHOOSH! Flames erupt!
They quickly spread, engulfing the floor and Pierce’s gift
lying on it. More screams!
Britta runs into the kitchen to get water.
Just then, Troy runs inside with the pizzas. In a minute his
world has been transformed into a nightmare of fire, blood,
and mayhem -- and sitting amidst it all, staring at Troy from
the charred package remains on the floor, is Torg the troll.

Jeff hands him some money. Pierce feels his moment slipping

This universe seems darker, grimmer. Abed, Troy, Jeff,

Abed! Pierce got shot in the leg

arm.
BRITTA
Exactly. Life got dark.
ABED
And all because Jeff rolled a one.
JEFF
I love that this is somehow my fault.
ABED
It’s mine. I’ve run through that
night over and over in my head, and
I keep coming back to one thought.
I should have caught the die and not
let you roll it. I failed to do
that. And we all suffered for it.
But I’m going to make it up to you.
He starts handing out pieces of black felt.
JEFF
What is this?
ABED
Of all the timelines, this is
clearly the darkest, which is why I
propose we commit to being evil.
I’ve made us all black goatees out
of felt. I suggest you put them on
until you’re able to grow your own.
He attaches a felt goatee to his face.
ABED (CONT’D)
From now on, I am Evil Abed, we are

I HATE YOU. SHUT UP WITH YOUR SCIFI CRAP. You’re the worst. I lost
my DAMN ARM and you’re making fake
beards!
Jeff exits. Britta and Shirley follow suit. Abed turns to
Troy. After a beat, Troy puts on his goatee. Abed smiles.
ABED / TROY (ALTERED ELECTRONIC VOICE)
(singing)
Evil Troy and Evil Abed!
They do their hand-shake. The sound of the LAST HAND SLAP
reverberates into:
36 INT. TROY AND ABED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT (NORMAL TIMELINE) 36
It’s our brighter, happier universe. Troy and Abed sit on
the couch, in pajamas, watching “Inspector Spacetime.”
Abed has a shiver go through him. He looks around.
TROY
What’s wrong?
ABED
I don’t know. I guess nothing.
They keep watching.
FADE OUT.
